While some conventional constructivists accept material forces as enabling or constraining factors (e.g., Wendt\u2019s \"rump materialism\"), others explicitly reject causal determinism, arguing that ideational and intersubjective factors dominate state action. The debate hinges on whether material capabilities are merely inputs (\"intervening variables\") or constitutive of outcomes.  \n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Question**: Assesses agreement among constructivists about material causality.  \n- **Analysis**: Recognizes that constructivist theory encompasses diverse approaches. While conventional constructivists occasionally integrate material factors (e.g., Wendt\u2019s inclusion of capabilities, geography), post-structuralists explicitly disentangle ideas from material constraints.  \n- **Answer**: Contradicts the assumption of universal agreement; clarifies that conflict exists between materialist and idealist constructivist strands.  \n- **Supporting Evidence**: Quotes Wendt\u2019s \"rump materialism\" as an exception, contrasts with post-structuralist focus on discourses over power dynamics.\n\nSources Used:\n- glenn- strategic culture&realism-cl.txt\n- dis_ch5_2.txt"}]}
