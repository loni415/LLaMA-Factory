In the sprawling economic domain in particular, wherein numerous technical issue areas make it impossible for one individual to track everything at the center let alone at the localities, Xi relies on a coterie of loyalists to carry out his will. Xi leans heavily on the CCP's Central Organization Department, a powerful Party organ that directly monitors, evaluates, and controls promotions for thousands of positions throughout the Party system, thus making it an immensely important institution to Xi's plans for economic grand steerage as well for the millions of cadres seeking promotion into positions of prominence.* The Organization Department's influence has only increased since 2018, when the State Administration of Civil Service, which formerly handled the appointment and assignment of state officials, was abolished and its functions absorbed into the Organization Department.\u00b9\u2076\u2076 Xi has filled the Organization Department's leadership role, effectively his \"chief personnel officer,\" with close associate Chen Xi, who was his roommate and close friend as a fellow \"worker-peasant-soldier student\" at Tsinghua University, when they both studied the same subject (chemical engineering) at the same time (1975\u20131979).\u00b9\u2076\u2077 Control over the Organization Department allows Xi not only to promote loyalists to any position within the \"leading cadre system,\" including the heads of the provincial organization departments, but also to embed his preferred economic promotion metrics into the evaluation criteria leading cadres compete to meet, mobilizing China's personnel apparatus to further his own politically informed economic development agenda.\u00b9\u2076\u2078 Xi's loyalists are also perched atop the key \"comprehensive\" economic decision units, namely those that are more important than specific functional bureaucracies. Most important in this regard is Liu He, who handles the relevant economic issues at both the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission. Liu, as with Chen Xi, is a close associate from Xi's youth.\u00b9\u2076\u2079 In the state bureaucracy, Xi also placed He Lifeng, one of his closest associates dating back to their time in Fujian in the 1980s, at the head of the National Development and Reform Commission.\u00b9\u2077\u2070 He could become Xi's top economic advisor, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal, taking over for Liu and overseeing day-to-day economic work at the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission.\u00b9\u2077\u00b9 Liu is over the implicit retirement age and, if the implicit norm holds, would vacate these positions at the 20th Party Congress.\u00b9\u2077\u00b2 *The leading cadre system is estimated to contain over two million positions, with roughly 2,500 at the provincial/ministerial level. Cadre evaluation has also become substantially more centralized over time, with the Organization Department promulgating a variety of more specific metrics, the provinces more closely monitoring the counties, and the center more closely monitoring the provinces for compliance.

Christopher Carothers, postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for the Study of Contemporary China and an expert on Xi's anticorruption campaign, has documented the rise of inspections and their transition from \"corruption control to everything control.\" 173 Dr. Carothers argues that the \"Xi administration initially strengthened inspections to combat corruption but then repurposed them to serve as a top-down governance mechanism in numerous other areas as well,\" including implementation of Xi's economic development initiatives. 174 Investigations and inspections have become tools to coerce a geographically and functionally fragmented and decentralized bureaucracy and group of local elites into compliance with top-down economic decisions. 175 Dr. Carothers notes that these visits \"produce a great deal of fear among bureaucrats and businesspeople,\" as inspectors' determinations, which are increasingly focused on substantively monitoring policy implementation, can have \"swift and dramatic consequences.\" 176 As in other domains, Xi relies in particular on the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and the National Supervisory Commission\u2014both of which are headed by Xi loyalists\u2014to enforce implementation of central economic decisions.* 177", "metadata": "CCP_Decision_Making_Xi_Chapter1_Feb2025_2.md", "judgement": true}, "1": {"text": "32.

Shortly after Xi came to power, a series of high-ranking senior PLA officers made public declarations of loyalty to him, with their statements receiving an unusual level of coverage in Party media.341 Beginning in 2016, official sources began using the title \"Commander in Chief\" in a push to paint Xi as a leader who understands and commands respect from the military, on some occasions even showing him wearing a military uniform while sitting upon a throne-like commander's chair.342 Xi has promulgated a military component of his personal ideology, so-called \"Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military,\" and his treatises are required reading for soldiers.343 State media encourage the armed forces to not only study and implement *In 2017, the PRC Constitution was amended to stipulate that the CMC chairman \"assumes overall responsibility over the work of the [CMC],\" indicating that Xi's voice almost certainly has the final say among the seven members of the CMC.

Peter Perdue, for one, has pointed out that \u201cChinese dynasties never shrank from the use of force.\u201d He argues that the \u201ccivilizing force\u201d model of ancient Chinese imperium\u2014in which China acquired expansive dominions as the result of benign \u201ccultural influence\u201d rather than force\u2014is not in fact an ancient verity. Instead, this concept originated among nationalist Chinese thinkers in the 1920s and 1930s as anti-Japanese propaganda discourse designed to whip up patriotic feelings of support for reclaiming an imagined ancient unity of harmonious Chinese peoples. According to Perdue, the \u201cideological view of Chinese history\u201d created by such apologetics was transmitted to early Western scholars trained in nationalist China, among them John King Fairbank, and hence moved into the Western mainstream. According to Scobell, it was only in the 1990s that historians began to peer behind such assumptions and recognize that a more \u201cassertive, aggressive China\u201d may in fact have existed. Taking an approach that might seem to split the difference between the archetypes of \u201cparabellum realism\u201d and Confucian-pacifist, \u201ccivilizational force\u201d models, Huiyun Feng has argued that structural realism provides only a \u201cpartial explanation\u201d for Chinese behavior. According to Feng, Chinese strategic culture is influenced by both the realpolitik statecraft literature of China\u2019s pre-unification Warring States period (475\u2013221 BCE) and Confucian ethical-moral traditions. Accordingly, she argues for a \u201crealism-plus-beliefs framework\u201d of analysis in which such Confucian traditions qualify what realism exists in China\u2019s strategic culture. In this analysis, Chinese behavior shows a \u201cbalance between Parabellum and Confucian propensities,\u201d with individual leaders each exhibiting different admixtures of realist and Confucian inclinations. (Feng argues that Mao Zedong exemplified realism, for example, while Deng Xiaoping tended more toward Confucianism.) In Feng\u2019s view, the net result of this balance is to make China not an \u201coffensive\u201d realist but instead a \u201cdefensive\u201d one. Yet beyond simply her use of the term realist, Feng\u2019s account differs little from the PRC\u2019s own self-justificatory and ostensibly Confucian-pacifist interpretation. According to Feng, for instance, although it is realist, China does not orient its foreign policy behavior around power or against threat but instead focuses on building constructive partnerships with other major powers. \u201cPeace-loving\u201d and \u201cnonviolence,\u201d she contends, are also \u201ckey characteristics of China\u2019s strategic culture.\u201d\nA third approach might be found in the work of Scobell. He agrees with Feng that Chinese strategic culture is dualistic, in that both conflict-averse and defensively minded Confucian elements and more military-focused and offensively oriented realpolitik elements coexist, ensuring that China is neither inherently pacifist nor inherently warlike. For Scobell, however, the realist elements seem more important, for these layers of strategic culture result in a Chinese \u201ccult of defense\u201d in which \u201crealist behavior dominates but is justified as defensive on the basis of a pacifist self-perception.\u201d In practice, he notes, while Chinese elites view China as being a defensive power and \u201cdeliberate in calculating\u201d the use of force, it is nonetheless \u201cprone to resort to force in a crisis.\u201d For Scobell, the \u201cshared myth\u201d of China\u2019s fundamentally defensive orientation allows leaders \u201cto rationalize virtually any military operation as a defensive action.\u201d\nJust as Feng\u2019s account ends up being more or less congruent with constructivist Confucian-pacifism, so also does Scobell\u2019s analysis thus end up being fairly congruent with Johnston\u2019s account of Chinese strategic culture. According to Johnston, for instance, while China has exhibited fairly consistent \u201chard realpolitik or parabellum strategic culture,\u201d even into the Maoist period\u2014including \u201ca preference for offensive uses of force, mediated by a keen sensitivity to relative capabilities\u201d\u2014this is not an abstract, structural realism but rather an \u201cideationally based hard realpolitik\u201d in which a Confucian-Mencian strand and a zero-sum, coercion-oriented parabellum strand coexist. Yet for Johnston, the Confucian-Mencian element is simply an \u201cidealized discourse\u201d important in Chinese rhetoric and self-image, whereas the hard realpolitik elements persist in actual Chinese practices.31 Scobell, one suspects, would broadly agree, as would Perdue, who observes that Chinese imperial rulers \u201cwaged war constantly against rival powers, although they often masked their campaigns as defensive actions against \u2018pirates\u2019 or \u2018rebels.\u2019 \u201d\nConfucian Flesh, Realist Bones \nHow, then, should one assess the relationship between realpolitik and more culturally idiosyncratic Sinic elements in Chinese strategic culture? To begin with, it is hard to deny that there is a powerful realism even in some of the most self-consciously Chinese elements of China\u2019s strategic culture. As Michael Pillsbury and others have noted\u2014and as we have seen even Huiyun Feng freely concede\u2014metaphors and statecraft concepts from China\u2019s Warring States period have recurred frequently in the writings of Chinese scholars attempting to understand the modern international arena.33 Extensive references to classics from that period are embedded throughout modern Chinese strategic writing and are used to provide lessons or metaphors with which to assess the future, making Warring States\u2013era concepts \u201cthe prism through which Chinese thinkers have viewed the post-Westphalia world.\u201d \nWhile this connection to and continuing invocation of ancient canonical sources may seem to add weight to the notion that Chinese strategic culture is indeed, in some sense, deeply and historically Chinese, it is important to remember just what a stereotypically realist strategic discourse much of this literature provides.", "metadata": "Ford - Realpolitik with Chinese Characteristics 2016.txt", "judgement": true}, "5": {"text": "Even a moral use of force unavoidably requires violating one moral principle to uphold another so a war deemed overall just according to Confucian standards, like wars justified according to realist beliefs, would still be undesirable, regrettable, and would require violating some moral principle about not doing harm. Additionally, at some level or type of threat, following Walzer\u2019s notion of \u201csupreme emergency,\u201d many of those influenced by Confucian ideals will agree with realists that the threatening circumstances now qualify as \u201cexceptional\u201d and so the obligation to uphold ideals and/or beliefs about the general inefficacy of war no longer apply. Reflecting Walzer\u2019s notion of \u201cdirty hands,\u201d whether decisions to use force were seen as moral, partially moral, immoral but necessary, or a convenient excuse is not by itself a good indicator of moral beliefs because it is strongly affected by the individual\u2019s perception of threat and their personal beliefs about what severity of threat creates \u201cexceptional\u201d conditions where \u201cnecessity\u201d permits otherwise-unacceptable behavior. Johnston, Scobell, and Wang turn to the concept of strategic culture to help discern the sincerity of ethical interpretations, applications, and justifications and, thus, whether Confucianism informs decisions about the use of force. This concept builds upon the contentious theory that states behave as rational actors by explaining how it can be rational for states to select different policy options to address similar issues despite the fact that this appears inconsistent or incoherent with the logical assumptions of realist theory. It does so by arguing that countries may differ in the \u201cset of fundamental and enduring assumptions about the role of collective violence in human affairs and the efficacy of applying force\u201d which, functioning as a \u201clens,\u201d shape the \u201cmenu of options available to an actor in various situations as well as affects an actor\u2019s perceptions or images of self and others\u201d. This establishes a testable relationship between country/culture-specific worldviews and beliefs about how state security and interests should and may be pursued. Realist assumptions that war is inevitable, it is a zero-sum world, and that most states hold that force is often the most effective tool for maximizing the superior power necessary for survival logically means to many that a state\u2019s use of force dare not be constrained by ideals. On the other hand, the idealistic Confucian worldview and the universal applicability of moral obligation to not harm others should result in a strong preference for less aggressive moral means. These scholars use strategic culture to extend rational decision making to argue that the underlying motive would also differ accordingly. Realist beliefs about the role and efficacy of violence would logically emphasize the imperative for greater power to ensure China\u2019s survival while a Confucian worldview would logically support the creation of a harmonious society to encourage the flourishing of all humans. Therefore, offensive/expansionist wars which occur more frequently when China believes it possesses greater power than the threat are better explained by realist theory while Confucianism would create opposite preferences for pragmatic as well as idealistic reasons. At the same time, \u201cas far as strategic culture analysts are concerned there is no universal model of rationality and what is rational for one state can be irrational for another\u201d. How ideals should and could be applied to national security issues may differ dramatically depending upon whether they pass through the \u201clens\u201d of, for example, limited rationality (where \u201cstrategic culture simplifies reality\u201d), process rationality (\u201cwhere strategic culture defines ranked preferences or narrows options\u201d), or adaptive rationality (\u201cwhere historical choices, analogies, metaphors, and precedents are invoked to guide choice\u201d). Accordingly, the methodology of the studies not only make the controversial assumption that states behave as rational actors but, by expanding what is considered \u201crational,\u201d there is greater variability in the views considered consistent with Confucianism than what is permitted by the current paradigmatic metrics. The distinction between offensive and defensive wars and the correlation between wars and perceived greater military power are used as indicators to not only test how well the realist paradigm explains China\u2019s strategic behavior but, in order for the same factors to also prove or disprove China\u2019s claims of Confucian influence, these realist preferences are considered incompatible with legitimate interpretations of Confucianism. However, the preferences used as indicators are not sufficiently distinct to conclude that behavior consistent with realist theory also invalidates the possible influence of the Confucian one. For example, Confucian values may align better with defensive options than offensive realist/realpolitik views but they do not require waiting until a growing threat has become the stronger military power to counter it using force. So, a correlation where the use of force increases with relative state power could derive from realist amoral aggressive calculations of efficacy or from Confucian moral considerations of efficacy such as proportionality and likelihood of success. Similarly, aggressive uses of force to counter threats when China has relative military advantage can be consistent with both the realist amoral goal to maximize state power and with the Confucian goal of a China-led harmonious society. Though the moral content may be opposite, the goal of both resemble regional hegemony and revisionist intentions. The strong sense of insecurity and threat in both worldviews similarly promotes the belief that the necessity of countering a menacing, unfriendly state with force could qualify as strict self-defense, a preventative war of self-defense, or a war that deters aggressors by increasing China\u2019s relative power. As discussed in the previous chapter, these may appear offensive, expansionist, and revisionist but they can also fit within the Confucian idea of punitive expeditions. The Confucian model also should not be rejected based upon the realist model fitting the evidence better because the models are also insufficiently comprehensive. For example, political realist theory and Johnston\u2019s quanbian (\u201cabsolute flexibility\u201d) don\u2019t explain why Ming Dynasty Confucian government officials justified their support for punitive expeditions against the weaker Mongols based upon China\u2019s moral superiority and obligation according to tianxia but also for why, even after China was much weakened from a series of defeats, they still refused to compromise with the barbarians. THE RELEVANCY OF CONFUCIANISM \nP. C. Lo\u2019s study of Confucianism in Qin and Han Dynasty politics is a good example of the persistent difficulties in differentiating between \u201cConfucian\u201d and \u201crealist\u201d behaviour.", "metadata": "dis_ch3_3.txt", "judgement": true}, "6": {"text": "Hu Jintao's leadership of the CCP from 2002 to 2012 saw the peak\nof the collective leadership model.12 A communique from the CCP's\n17th Party Congress, held in 2007, formally defined the model as \"a\nsystem with a division of responsibilities among individual leaders\nin an effort to prevent arbitrary decision-making by a single top\nleader.\"13 The CCP's adoption of a collective leadership model insti-\ntuted a consensus-based approach toward decision-making whereby\nthe top leader builds consensus around his specific policy proposals. *Deng Xiaoping first articulated the need for the CCP to adopt a collective leadership system,\nwriting in 1980 that CCP leadership required radical reform to guard against the risk of overcon-\ncentration of power.

Despite stated commitments to equal opportunity and fair representation by the CCP and the Chinese government,\u2021 women have limited representation and voice across the top echelons of China's political system.15 Historically, female representatives have rarely constituted more than 10 percent of the roughly 300-member CCP Central Committee.16 Only 6 women have ever served in the 25-member Politburo, half of whom were the wives of other top leaders.17 No woman has ever served on the Politburo Standing Committee or held any of the top three positions in China's political system: CCP general secretary, chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), and state chairman.\u00a718 Female representation in key government roles such as ministries and provincial governorships is also extremely low.19 The percentage of People's Liberation Army (PLA) servicemembers who are female is not publicly available, but a Chinese military newspaper estimated in 2015 that approximately 5 percent or fewer were women.20 Currently, no women hold senior command or political commissar positions in the PLA.21 | Informal rules and procedures have emerged alongside a shift to\ncollective decision-making. These norms include mandatory retire-\nment age and term limits for CCP Politburo members, cadre eval-\nuation systems, and regional representation in the CCP Central\nCommittee.

The emperor should be humane by loving and nurturing the lives of all peoples with sympathy and compassion, and be gracious by being generous and tolerant towards them, so acting in accordance with the Confucian li and yi. He should try to develop integrity and trustworthiness in fulfilling these principles. Most important of all, he should always strive to cultivate his moral excellence as the ultimate means to attract the emulative submission of peoples from afar. Confucianism\u2019s optimism about human nature means that the international system is not seen as a \u201cfundamentally antagonistic\u201d place. Confidence in the efficacy and rectitude of the Confucian system and in the innate inclination of humans to be moral means that ethical transgressions are often being attributed to a lack of proper understanding rather than evil intent. Especially since the inherently destructive nature of war only further disrupts harmony , the use of force is considered \u201cinauspicious,\u201d \u201cto be avoided,\u201d and a \u201clast resort\u201d. A more effective and more humane corrective action than forcing compliance is to provide role models and education that demonstrate the superiority of Confucian China and that encourages proper behavior. Other states were permitted to subscribe to non-Confucian systems and often to retain autonomy as long as, in accordance with the power dynamics explicated in the Confucian model, they still \u201cshow submission in return for Chinese protection\u201d and \u201cpay tributes\u201d to China. These rules of propriety indicated that the international system was properly ordered and that interstate relationships were in harmony. Thus, non-Confucian states were provided with the resources that would convince them of the superiority of the Chinese Confucian model of moral governance. China\u2019s possession of the Mandate of Heaven, its conviction of moral and cultural superiority, and its belief to be the center of the universe meant that the ruler\u2019s authority extended to all on earth and it was his responsibility to make sure that all people enjoyed the benefits of living in a properly ordered society. As a result, there was little differentiation between internal and external threats or how they should be addressed. Immediate threats resistant to moral measures may require being countered using deterrence, accommodation, and coercion while the preferred method of long term enculturation takes effect. A similar argument for accommodation and enculturation was made when China was occupied by foreigners. Avoiding or limiting war is ideal but, when war was deemed the necessary response, as the contemporary Chinese scholar Tiewa Liu of Beijing Foreign Studies University sums, \u201cthey [Confucians] think moral principles rather than national interests should be the primary concern when launching a war\u201d. Similarly, the most important consideration for how to use force morally is that it is done with ren and yi. Still, as Mencius states, even \u201cusing force in the name of humaneness\u201d was immoral and qualified as hegemony. The corpus of military strategy, The Seven Military Classics, also acknowledges that the Confucian notion of a just or righteous war means that war may \u201csometimes be necessary\u201d and so can be just/righteous but it \u201cis deeply deplorable; it is bad and tragic\u201d. That war is never fully moral implies there to be a moral remainder that closely resembles the Western notion of \u201cdirty hands.\u201d Lo seems to further allude to this by contrasting the Confucian view that \u201cthe prima facie wrongness of mass killing, intentional or collateral, persists in spite of being outweighed by other, weightier moral concerns\u201d to the Western view that \u201c[t]he morality or immorality of any use of armed force is, finally... a matter of... who uses it, why, and how\u201d. At the same time, the greater moral consideration of context and intent attributed to Western ethics than to Confucian virtue ethics is contrary to their general characterizations. Indeed, Confucianism\u2019s lack of \u201cmoral absolutism\u201d and, instead, its emphasis on the specific situation, suggests that there exists no concept similar to \u201cdirty hands\u201d. Even if the Confucian morality of war cannot consider context, as Lo argues, the prerequisite virtue necessary for someone to occupy a position of leadership makes it highly unlikely there was the belief that \u201ca political leader must sometimes do the wrong thing to do the right thing\u201d. Furthermore, Confucianism did not hold there to be \u201ctwo separate standards for the political and the moral, which implies the impossibility of the problem of dirty hands\u201d. Notwithstanding the potential disagreement about the possibility of dirty hands, these preferences are consistent with Confucian pacifistic beliefs but they also could derive from other motives. The moral imperative of Confucian harmony creates little room for alternative views and beliefs. Morality that reinforces the status quo hierarchy for Confucians serves a similar purpose as the strict rules used by the Legalists. As Zhang points out, \u201cthe Confucian argument on a strong, unitary state is in line with the Legalist argument that domestic unity is the key to interstate competitiveness, a position also held by the Chinese government today\u201d. It is difficult to determine the sincerity of moral justifications since, for example, the morality and pragmatic efficacy of using force against an occupier or a competitor state powerful enough to resist China\u2019s demands suggests that accommodation is the better option. Similarly, the moral basis of the tributary system could incentivize wars for self-interested reasons as, at times, it led to Chinese rulers seeking to expand the number of tributary states as a testament to the \u201cvirtue and legitimacy\u201d of their rule. The conditions that qualify for using force as \u201cself-defense,\u201d \u201cdefense of others,\u201d and \u201conly as a last resort\u201d make it further difficult to distinguish the roles of self-interest and moral incentives. For example, the moral obligations of possessing the Mandate of Heaven includes ensuring that all people are governed according to Confucian humaneness and benevolence \u2013 which the Confucian ruler of China is most qualified to do. Tolerance for other states to use non-Confucian forms of governance is contingent on them fulfilling the rituals of the tributary system. Yet, it is a moral requirement of virtuous behavior and a necessity for self-defense that China must be the most powerful state and other states must recognize China\u2019s moral and physical superiority by complying with its stipulated norms.", "metadata": "dis_ch2_2.txt", "judgement": true}, "8": {"text": "In addition, the organizational culture of socialism is thought to have been influential in the total shifting of responsibility to the outside world. Inherent in Marxism is the logic that no one can be held accountable for results as long as the motive is pure. In addition, bureaucracy provides little opportunity to correct its own mistakes. Since there is no opposition party or media in China that freely criticizes the government authorities, society is flooded with self-praise and criticism of foreign countries pushed exclusively by propaganda organs. According to sociologist Max Weber, ethical consciousness in politics can be divided into ethics of conviction and ethics of responsibility. An ethicist of responsibility believes that he must assume all the consequences of one\u2019s actions and that one is responsible for the consequences. An ethicist of conviction is a person of pure conviction who considers himself absolved of any failure or evil that results from such conviction, placing the blame on others, and does not believe that responsibility lies in consequences. Therefore, the ethicist of conviction does not hold himself responsible for the consequences of righteous actions, even if they go wrong, but instead holds others responsible. 3. International Structural Perceptions Next, we will examine contemporary China's perception and behavior toward the outside world. The aforementioned Michael Pillsbury discovered from examining papers published by researchers at Chinese think tanks that Chinese elites analyze international relations by quoting the Chinese classics. Pillsbury cites examples of nine researchers from five Chinese think tanks who drew experiences and lessons from the Chinese Warring States Period and ancient statecraft. According to Pillsbury, the Chinese researchers believed that the age in which the classics of Chinese statecraft were produced was a time when a multistate competition to become \u201chegemon\u201d featured stratagems, small wars, interstate conferences, treaties, and what Western scholars of international relations would label \u201canarchy.\u201d Therefore, they argue, the experience and lessons gained were about \"how to become a hegemon,\" and \"how to survive at the hands of a predatory hegemon.\" Using these classics, some Chinese scholars assess the United States as a powerful hegemon and explore the path that China should take. For example, in a discussion of \"multipolarity,\" a post-Cold War perception of foreign affairs characteristic of China, a Chinese People's Liberation Army researcher noted that the future \"multipolar\" world bear a striking resemblance to the Warring States Period, and that Sun Tzu's Art of War was \"a product of a multipolar situation in China 2,500 years ago\u201d. In terms of foreign relations, China has traditionally held to the ideas of working individually against weaker states, resorting to a team with other states as an expedient against stronger states (hezonglianhe), seeking to strengthen relations with distant states in order to deal with neighbors with whom a state is at odds (yuanjiaogjingong), and preserving one\u2019s own state by having a foreign state attack another threatening foreign state (yiyizhiyi). The history researcher Liu Jie also points out that this traditional Chinese mindset is the very essence of classical power politics, and that there are those who liken current international relations to China's \"Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods,\" and that such idea has gained wide acceptance. Chisako Masuo also points out that China has a \"tendency to portray the world as a whirlpool of intrigue\" and \"an extremely strong predilection to regard relations between great powers through a conspiratorial lens\u201d. There is thus a tendency in China to hold a realist view of the world. Conclusion--The Source of Unique Ideas This paper has attempted to discuss to what extent China's foreign perceptions, strategies and actions can be interpreted through strategic culture theory. The main reason is that the logic of interpreting China's foreign perceptions, strategies and actions is based on a Legalist (i.e., essentially realist) logic. China prefers in particular the analogy of the Warring States Period when interpreting the multipolar world. But when explaining or justifying its own actions, it uses Confucian (i.e., essentially liberalist) logic. From its \"New Security Concept\" to its use of force, China goes to great lengths to emphasize its \"moral righteousness,\" claiming that other countries are entirely responsible for the problems that have arisen. Through the massive and prolonged dissemination of this discourse through its propaganda apparatus, China has in effect inculcated in its own people the same ideas as its government. Probably this is why they do not strongly question their own discourse. Moreover, socialist characteristics are latent in the above two logical approaches. There are two ideological and cultural currents in China that are something more than simply analogies to the two major theories of contemporary international relations. We can point to the penetration of systematic justification by the Communist Party in the more thorough and methodical criticism of the external world and self-justification. In China, the entire population is expected to liberalistically extol the actions of their country, just as the propaganda organs do. Thus, the opening statement by Xi Jinping is also a natural part of the discourse in China.", "metadata": "Matsuda - China's Strategic Culture Hypothesis 2022.txt", "judgement": true}, "9": {"text": "It is, however, a fundamental difference between classical and structural political realist theory. The overwhelming majority of respondents agreed with the structural notion that competition over limited resources was the primary cause of wars (86%/88%) while 12%/10% said it was due to human nature and 2%/2% said for other reasons . These results may also be influenced by the Confucian-Mencian belief that humans are inherently good. However, human behavior should to be seen as the primary cause for most conflicts in order to believe that providing proper role models and moral education are more effective than using force to resolve them. Force would be considered necessary and more effective if survival depends upon winning the constant competition over limited resources in an anarchic world. Thus, the structural realist view supported by the majority of respondents was not coherent with the logic underlying Confucian strategic preferences. Respondents were asked about how \u201cpoliticians from [their own or of foreign countries] should in practice see the role morality plays in international affairs.\u201d The versions had the same relative ranking of the answer options although the strength of support for each answer significantly differed . The most popular response, by far, was that \u201cGovernments and individuals have different roles and responsibilities so they have different standards of what is right and wrong. For a government, what is morally right is what best meets its obligations to its people - the survival of the country and the good of its own citizens\u201d (46%/50%). With less than half the support \u2013 but still much more than for the remaining options \u2013 was another \u201cDirty Hands\u201d belief that \u201cWhat is morally correct should always be considered and usually followed. However, although it does not make it morally right, sometimes it is necessary for a country to behave immorally in order to protect its citizens\u201d (22%/22%). Moral preference to those with whom there is a special relationship is acceptable according to Confucianism but not when it is at the strong detriment of others. The inextricable relationship between morality and politics means that politics and politicians are not subject to different moral rules or standards than regular citizens . The contextual nature of Confucian virtue ethics also means that there are no absolute moral rules to break and, thus, no concept analogous to Western Dirty Hands . Strong moral beliefs were seen by the 14%/11% of respondents who felt that \u201cMorality should shape politics even if doing so means that it constrains and sometimes disadvantages one\u2019s own country.\u2019\u201d A slightly smaller (9%/9%) portion of respondents held the opposing political realist amoral view that \u201cThere are universal rights and wrongs but they only apply to how people should treat one another. The world is too competitive and too dangerous to allow these rules to limit the political and military options available to governments and countries.\u2019\u201d Finally, 8%/7% said \u201cThere are few or no universal moral standards, morality is just an excuse used by powerful countries to justify preventing weaker countries from challenging the way things currently are.\u201d Like Machiavelli, a notable majority recognized that international politics does have a moral component - though most of them also felt that, in one way or another, state self-interest was either a legitimate bias for assessing what is moral or that it served as a legitimate exemption from ordinary morality . Subtler bias from state interest was also seen in the response patterns for this question. For example, there was greater support for the politics of foreign countries to be constrained by morality than for the respondent\u2019s own country to be so limited. Additionally, respondents thinking of their own country more strongly believed that governments have the moral obligation to prioritize its own people over those of other countries. Compared to the responses above, which all presuppose that morality does belong in politics in some way, there was less bias from those who felt that politics are amoral. Consistent with political realist theory, respondents who believed that politics are amoral saw this as a universally true and applicable condition. Response patterns for this question indicated that the majority\u2019s moral beliefs about state behavior and the use of force, as identified in this study, was based upon how well the proposed act meets the state\u2019s obligation to do what is best for its citizens (68%/72%). This suggested that the assessed morality of such acts would likely be fairly similar for both leaders as well as normal citizens who were reporting what they felt was moral for leaders to do. However, it was also possible that, instead, respondents based the morality of these acts on what they felt individuals rather than states may and may not do. If this were the case, many would consider using force even more permissible for their government if it fulfilled the obligation of the state to prioritize the good of its own people. In summary, composite scores and responses to individual questions did not reflect strong Confucian views of the international system. Statistical models confirmed there to be stronger consensus about less idealistic views for those thinking about their own country than for those thinking of foreign ones. Some evidence of Confucian values was seen from the approximately half of respondents who supported compromise and cooperation though views became more biased as zero-sum direct conflicts of interest were introduced. Support for Confucian virtues was further tempered by an overall generally realist worldview and the fairly widespread belief that greater absolute military power was still essential for national security. Despite morality largely being seen as a legitimate component of politics, it could be quickly disregarded or more favorably redefined when it conflicted with state self-interest. This was more acceptable for the respondent\u2019s own country and as the perceived stakes increased. There was widespread recognition that states \u2013 especially China \u2013 should cooperate and/or compete not as how best expresses virtue or promotes a harmonious world but rather as is best for state self-interest. H3: Confucianism does not influence beliefs about when force should be and can be used. Moral ideals and their influence on the decision to use force were examined by asking whether it was \u201cmorally okay to use force,\u201d \u201cforce may be used only because this is an exceptional circumstance but it is still morally wrong,\u201d or if it \u201cis not okay to use force\u201d for five self-defense scenarios and two scenarios about coming to the defense of others. The country of consideration for all questions differed according to survey version.

Rather, there is generally a high degree of military involvement in domestic political, social and economic affairs, and sometimes even a close integration of the military, political and social structures, although there are significant differences in the forms of this involvement and in the extent of military-civil integration. In some states (such as Indonesia), there was no pre-colonial army to develop so-called \"professional\" traditions. In many states, military formations born in the struggle for national liberation have maintained extensive political involvements. In some states, the colonial heritage has resulted in relatively weak or illegitimate political and other institutional structures and authorities, providing the military with both the incentive and the necessary political and social conditions for active involvement in \"non-military\" affairs. Moreover, in those societies with long military traditions (such as China and Vietnam), those traditions actually emphasize a close inter-relationship between the military and society rather than prescribing formal differentiation. As Sun Tzu noted around 400 BC, the military tend to possess a high degree of administrative and directive competence which is readily applicable to other areas of public life. When not training or fighting, the military, should be involved in \"agro-military\" activities such as settlement of remote areas or cultivating the land, or engaged in laboring on other public projects. The close integration of the military into national polities and societies throughout much of East and Southeast Asia is manifested in various forms. Some countries are ruled by military regimes - such as Burma (Myanmar), where the State Law and Order Council (SLORC) maintains an unabashed military dictatorship. Other countries can be defined as \"indirect military regimes, proper,\" in which the governments exercise their power \"only in consequence of behind-the-scenes military muscle\" (for example, North Korea); \"intermittently indirect military regimes,\" where a powerful and self-confident military intervenes from time to time to change the leaders or the course of an avowedly civilian regime (for example, Thailand); or \"military-supportive regimes,\" which are \"indubitably civilian\" but which rely on extensive military support for their survival (for example, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines). In some countries, the involvement of the military in political, economic and social affairs is legitimized by arguments and justifications which are just as explicit and as sophisticated as those concerning military \"professionalism\" and civil-military differentiation in Western democracies. This is particularly the case in the communist states where the regimes came to power through \"People's War.\" In China, for example, the close inter-relationship between the military and the polity and society is derived from a history which can be traced back at least as far as the time of Sun Tzu (c. 400 BC), as tempered by the thought of Mao Zedong. The basic relationship between the military and civil organizations was articulated by Mao in November 1938: Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. Our principle is that the [Communist] party commands the gun; the gun shall never be allowed to command the party. But it is also true that with the gun at our disposal we can really build up the party organizations. In the structure of the power apparatus, the military is kept firmly under party and hence political control, but it is also true that the Party could not maintain power without the active support of the military. \"Professionalism\" and civil-military differentiation were described by Mao as \"purely military viewpoints\" and \"erroneous conceptions.\" According to Mao: The Red Army must not merely fight; besides fighting, it should also shoulder such important tasks as agitating among the masses, organizing them, arming them, and helping them to set up political power .... Apart from such objectives, fighting loses its meaning and the Red Army the reason for its existence. The military is required to \"consolidate its relations with the masses\" by engaging in such non-military activities as building roads and bridges, harvesting crops, operating small factories and state farms, reclaiming waste land, laboring with workers and peasants, and acting as adjudicators of political orthodoxy. In Indonesia the army has never regarded itself as being restricted to an exclusively military role, and for most of its history it has played a major political role. In the immediate post-independence period, it saw itself as essentially the \"guardian\" of the new state, but it soon asserted its right to participate continuously in political life. After the introduction of martial law in 1957, it expanded its involvement not only in politics but also in the broader fields of general administration and economic management. In 1965--66, the army developed the doctrine, which was codified as dwifungsi (or 'dual functions') during the New Order, according to which the army had not just the military role of defending the nation but also a \"social - political\" role which extended to activities in \"the ideological, political, social, economic, cultural and religious fields.\" As an army seminar declared in August 1966: The army, which was born in the cauldron of the Revolution, has never been a dead instrument of the government concerned exclusively with security matters. The army, as a fighter for freedom, cannot remain neutral toward the course of state policy, the quality of the government, and the safety of the state based on Panca Sila [that is, the general principles of belief in one God, humanitarianism, national unity, representative and consultative government, and social justice]. The army does not have an exclusively military duty but is concerned with all fields of social life. Since the mid-1970s, President Suharto has progressively \"civilianized\" the government, and the direct involvement of the military in economic activities has also declined, at least in relative terms.\" However, the military still wields considerable power in Indonesian society. The Suharto regime may not be a military regime, but it is a \"military-supportive regime\" which remains dependent upon the military for the exercise of power.", "metadata": "ball-strategic culture in asia pacific-cleaned.txt", "judgement": true}, "11": {"text": "Since then other works have utilized the strategic culture approach, including this writer\u2019s China\u2019s Use of Military Force: Beyond the Great Wall and the Long March (2003). A significant number of volumes, journal articles, and book chapters have been published that focus on China and invoke the term, but their depth of coverage varies widely. Building on the scholarship of Alastair Iain Johnston and my own earlier work, I define strategic culture as \u2018the set of fundamental and enduring assumptions about the role of collective violence in human affairs and the efficacy of applying force interpreted by a country\u2019s political and military elites\u2019. This is broadly consistent with prevailing approaches to strategic culture, as outlined in the introductory article. This conception characterizes culture as part context and part lens \u2013 something that shapes the menu of options available to an actor in various situations as well as affects an actor\u2019s perceptions or images of self and others. Indeed, the presence of strategic culture can be so all-pervasive that its existence is not even noticed or its impact is not even recognized. Moreover, assumptions based upon it may be so readily accepted that the stereotypes or biases it produces are not even challenged or questioned. My psycho-cultural approach is perhaps most similar to what Johnston dubs the \u2018second generation\u2019 of strategic culture scholarship and the work of international relations scholars such as Robert Jervis. Demolishing a Wall and Constructing a Cult \nThe scholarship of historian Arthur Waldron has laid bare the myth of a Great Wall the origins of which date back to the Emperor Qin Shihuang, widely considered the first emperor to unify China in 221 BCE. Waldron\u2019s meticulous research revealed that what we now think of as the Great Wall only dates back to the Ming dynasty (1368\u2013 1644). While numerous dynasties have engaged in the construction of walls, there was never a single fortification stretching from Central Asia in the far west to Shanhaiguan on the eastern coast. Moreover, successive dynasties did not exhibit a cultural proclivity for static defences although many dynasties constructed fortifications. Indeed, wall building in the Ming dynasty was actually the result of political compromise. In the 1470s, China faced a threat from Mongol nomads living in the Ordos region of Central Asia and the Ming court explored various policy options. Although an offensive strategy had appeal, military expeditions were risky with soldiers and horses in short supply. The Ming court adopted a positional defence policy and commenced building its wall. Meanwhile, the scholarship of political scientist Alastair Iain Johnston under mined the myth of a single Confucian strategic tradition extending back more than 2,000 years. Focusing on the Ming dynasty, Johnston identified the existence of two strands of Chinese strategic culture: a \u2018Parabellum\u2019 (or Realpolitik) one and a\u2018Confucian-Mencian\u2019 one. Moreover, he concluded that of these two strands, only one \u2013 the Realpolitik strand \u2013 was operative and the second was purely for \u2018idealized discourse\u2019. Other research emphasizes the influence of an array of traditions such as legalism and Daoism as well as popular myths and folk traditions. This author\u2019s own research also discerns the existence of two strands of Chinese strategic culture but, unlike Johnston, I argue that both the Realpolitik and Confucian Mencian strands are operative. In fact, the two strands interact in a dialectic fashion to produce a distinctive \u2018Chinese Cult of Defence\u2019. The outcome is that Chinese elites fervently believe that China is under the sway of a unique peace-loving, non-expan sionist, defensive-minded strategic tradition. Because of the interaction between different strands of strategic culture and the way China\u2019s strategists define \u2018defence\u2019, virtually any use of force by China is defensive in nature. Thus, paradoxically China is more disposed to use force when confronting a political-military crisis than it might otherwise be. Johnston\u2019s research suggests that China is a Realpolitik power that historically has not shrunk from using force. This writer\u2019s own research has expanded upon Johnston\u2019s basic findings, suggesting that while China\u2019s elites view the world in Realpolitik terms, at the same time they perceive China\u2019s own strategic culture as Confucian or pacifist and defensive-minded. The Cult of Defence identifies six principles that influence the decision-making of Chinese elites: (1) the primacy of national unification; (2) heightened threat perceptions; (3) the concept of active defence; (4) Chinese just war theory; (5) domestic chaos phobia; and (6) an emphasis on the welfare of the community over that of the individual. The combined effect of these principles is a predisposition by China to resort to force in a crisis, a marked tendency towards risk-taking, and justifications of the use of force in terms of the big picture. Under the influence of the Cult of Defence, Chinese civilian and military leaders perceive their use of military force as extremely limited. They firmly believe that Beijing only turns to military force with great reluctance and with far less frequency than leaders in other capitals around the world. Chinese elite thinking on the use of force can be summed up in the following tongue-in-cheek mantra: \u2018Use force sparingly; repeat as often as needed\u2019. In addition, the record of communist China\u2019s use of force since 1949 reveals a disturbing habit of calculated risk-taking. While Chinese leaders do not use force lightly or without a considerable amount of thought, they are prone to believe that calculated risks are worth taking. They seem confident that China can ensure escalation control by strictly limiting the scale, area, and timing of its application of military power. Moreover, when Chinese look at their record of the use of force, they conclude there has been a 100 percent success rate. Finally, when Chinese leaders deliberate about when and how to use force, they do not think in terms of operational victory. For them, the criterion of success is the impact of the operation on the \u2018overall situation\u2019. If they can conclude that China has bought some time and deterred an adversary from committing future acts of aggression, they feel the operation was justified.", "metadata": "Scobell - China s Real Strategic Culture A Great Wall of the Imagination-cl.txt", "judgement": true}, "12": {"text": "Some writers on strategic culture have sought to provide supplementary explanations of short term behavior that deviate from neorealism\u2019s prediction of the long-term competitive behavior of states. Snyder, for example, considered culture to be a residual label that is affixed to \u2018\u2018explain\u2019\u2019 outcomes that cannot be explained in any more concrete way. Thus, culture, including strategic culture, is an explanation to be used only when all else fails. In principle, differences in military strategy across states might be explained solely in terms of objective differences in the structure of their external or internal circumstances, without regard to subjective cultural differences. Waltz similarly does not seek to refute the argument that variables such as strategic culture have an impact on international outcomes when theorizing the international arena. An example of this can be found in the following passage where he encapsulates the nature of an environment where power is a cause of international outcomes but not the only one: To identify power with control is to assert that only power is needed in order to get one\u2019s way. That is obviously false, else what would there be for political and military strategists to do? To use power is to apply one\u2019s capabilities in an attempt to change someone else\u2019s behavior in certain ways. Whether A, in applying its capabilities, gains the wanted compliance of B depends on A\u2019s capabilities and strategy, on B\u2019s capabilities and counterstrategy, and on all of these factors as they are affected by the situation in hand. Power is one cause among others, from which it cannot be isolated. There are several variants of this theme, such as those expressed in the \u2018\u2018defensive\u2019\u2019 realist versus the \u2018\u2018offensive\u2019\u2019 realist debate.\n \nGood strategy will thus ensure that objectives are attained while poor strategy will lead to the ineffective execution of a state\u2019s power. If a state continues to adopt such strategies, then, like inefficient companies in a free market, their power and influence will diminish. It is also assumed that strategies that fail to attain a state\u2019s objectives will, in all probability, evolve or be abandoned. Epiphe nomenal strategic culture does not therefore necessarily contradict the assumptions underpinning neorealism. Waltz warns against what he regards as overly simplistic definitions of power and it is apparent from his discussion that in the application of power, strategy will be an important determinant of its effectiveness. Moreover, strategy can be influenced by a variety of factors. However, epiphenomenal strategic culture does challenge the ahistorical and acultural assumptions of rationality posited in game theory put forward by, among others, Thomas Schelling. The key challenge is directed at the assumption that there is \u2018\u2018a single, universal strategic rationality, which will be adopted by \u2018any player who had his wits about him\u2019\u2019\u2019 . Some also questioned the Schelling\u2019s assumption of common interest by arguing that while the objective of US nuclear policy was to avoid all out nuclear war the Soviet attitude was more pragmatic. Rather than choices depending on expectations of what the other side might do, the Soviet military had consistently favored highly offensive, in contrast to defensive, strategies. This had practical implications as it was said to have created a \u2018\u2018cult of the offensive\u2019\u2019 . Others argued that instead of attempting to replicate the United States\u2019 force posture, the geography of the former Soviet Union meant that the army traditionally constituted the main component of the Soviet military forces. Less emphasis was placed on the role of the Soviet navy, which was viewed as fulfilling a supporting role. Although this situation changed with the advent of the Sea-Launched Ballistic Missile in the 1960s, a system which was seen as providing an assured second-strike nuclear deterrent capability, land-based forces did not lose their primary position. Another challenge stemmed from those who questioned the assumption of a value-maximizing form of behavior by examining the competition for economic resources and the adoption of certain strategies in order to increase the military\u2019s budget . Many of the writings located in this conception might thus be regarded as well suited to demonstrating the way that the strategic culture of a country can produce a sub-optimal outcome when attempting to achieve the objectives identified by Waltz. The Conventional Constructivists\u2019 Conception These analysts, as well as those above, use empirical cases combined with causal theorizing to produce explanations of particular identifiable behavioral patterns. What distinguishes the second conception from the first is its adoption of a constructivist approach. In contrast to those writers who regard culture and norms as having only an epiphenomenal effect on state behavior, they argue that \u2018\u2018cultural environments affect not only the incentives for different kinds of state behavior but also the basic character of states\u2014what we call state \u2018identity\u2019\u2019. Equally, constructivism may encompass a variety of epistemological approaches and it may therefore be more accurate to refer to the group of writers currently under consideration as adopting a conventional constructivist approach who \u2018\u2018subscribe to a notion of social causality that takes reasons as causes\u2019\u2019 . It thus embraces those who believe that \u2018\u2018ideas are not merely rules or \u2018road maps\u2019 for action, but rather\u2019\u2019 that \u2018\u2018ideas operate \u2018all the way down\u2019 to actually shape actors and action in world politics\u2019\u2019 and also attempt to identify regular (albeit contingent) patterns of behavior that arise from these beliefs and ideas. Conventional constructivists thus \u2018\u2018hold the view that the building blocks of international reality are ideational as well as material\u2026at the level of individual actors, constructivism also seeks to map the full array of additional ideational factors that shape actors\u2019 outlooks and behavior, ranging from culture and ideology, to aspiration and principled beliefs, on to cause \u2044 effect knowledge of specific policy problems\u2019\u2019 . \nConventional constructivists examining strategic culture thus combine causal theorizing with empirical validation to produce explanations of particular patterns of behavior. Yet, at the same time, these analysts take the view that identities constitute interests and actions. Neo-realists and neoliberals consciously bracket questions of interest formation, treating preferences as exogenously determined givens that exist prior to social interaction. Constructivists, on the other hand, argue that understanding how interests are constituted is the key to explaining a wide range of international phenomena that rationalists have either misunderstood or ignored.", "metadata": "glenn- strategic culture&realism-cl.txt", "judgement": true}, "13": {"text": "The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is widely considered Xi's \"signature\" foreign policy initiative, provides an illustration of the top-down, Party-centered, and personalized foreign policymaking process in the Xi era.256 Official descriptions* of BRI trace its development from an idea originating with Xi himself, through high-level Party coordination, to elaboration within central government ministries, and finally to lower-level implementation by local governments and in the international arena.257 The process exhibits a high degree of vertical coordination in which lower-level decisions are mandated within the framework set out for them from above.258 Yuen Yuen Ang, associate professor at the University of Michigan, describes BRI as a clear example of a \"policy campaign\" in which the top leader mobilizes bureaucrats and other stakeholders to support a single vision, which may initially be relatively loosely defined.259 Throughout the process, Xi has remained both a driving force behind BRI's privileged status and a gatekeeper for policy adjustments. The combination of his personal leadership and a strict interpretation of China's national security interests leave little space for meaningful policy changes. ### Top-Down, Party-Centric Mobilization The guiding concept and overall design for BRI originated at the top of the system, and Xi announced its original components in two international speeches in September and October 2013.\u2020260 Since *A speech by Xi in November 2021 clearly illustrated the top-down design of the BRI, insisting: \"It is necessary to persist in the Party's centralized and unified leadership; the Leading Small Group must grasp well the coordination and control of major plans, major policies, major items, major issues, and annual key tasks. Relevant departments must incorporate joint construction of the 'Belt and Road' into the important agenda and make overall plans for effective implementation of international project construction and risk prevention and control responsibilities. Local governments must find an orientation to participate in the joint construction of the 'Belt and Road.'\" Similarly, an official description of BRI posted by China's representative mission to the UN traces the idea directly from Xi's introduction, to the creation of a CCP leading group, to the publication of government plans, to the eventual consultation with other countries in international fora and BRI's incorporation into the agenda in international organizations.

However, this classification does serve to demonstrate that, just as in the case of realism, strategic culture is best regarded as \u2018\u2018a general approach to international politics, not a single theory,\u2019\u2019 general approach to international politics rather than single theory. The first two conceptions broadly agree epistemologically and methodologically each seeks to infer causal relations between a given strategic culture and behavior and to develop generalizations that can then be tested. However, the first views strategic culture as epiphenomenal whereas the second conception does not. Epiphenomenal strategic culture would therefore appear best suited to the task, a la Desch, of supplementing neorealism. Rather than supplanting realism, epiphenomenal strategic culture shows, \u2018\u2018some promise of supplementing realist theories by explaining lags between structural change and state behavior, accounting for deviant state behavior, and explaining behavior in structurally indeterminate environments\u2019\u2019 . In other words, ideational factors would still be regarded as epiphenomenal, whereas structural constraints should be deemed the primary cause of state behavior. On the other hand, the last three conceptions of strategic culture agree that strategic cultures \u2018\u2018are not epiphenomena of unitary states acting under anarchy. A general approach in the sense that there are a variety of contending theories within this school of thought. Refer to Lynn-Jones and Miller. Jeffrey W. Legro and Andrew Moravcsik similarly argue that realism \u2018\u2018is not a single theory but a family of theories\u2014a \u2018paradigm\u2019\u2019\u2019. and constrained by material power structures.\u2019\u2019 However, each of the last three conceptions differs both epistemologically and in their research objectives . The conventional constructivists seek to identify regular patterns of behavior, the possible causal mechanisms behind such patterns and \u2018\u2018contingent\u2019\u2019 generalizations about these patterns of behavior. The post-structur alist school, on the other hand, engages in identifying links between ideational factors and outcomes but view these links as discrete cases. Finally, the interpretive conception treats each culture in a sui generis manner, opting for what they see as a deeper understanding obtained through immersing themselves in the particular culture under investigation. For the epiphenomenal conception, one may wish to conduct a cross-national study of states that have adopted suboptimum strategies and in doing so assess how influential strategic culture was in these cases and why it led to critical failures (that is, a decline in relative power) in some cases but not others. The second conception could engage in two separate tasks. First, it could offer an explanation that is on par or better than the neorealist account of events. Second, it could offer a comparative account (either across cases or across time) of the similarities and differences between the strategic cultures under study and the similarities and differences in behavioral outcomes that arise as a result. Jeffrey Legro\u2019s work on identifying macro-correlations between the adoption of a norm (in this case against chemical warfare, strategic bombing and submarine warfare) and a state\u2019s preference for a particular use of force is a good example of the use of small n comparisons using historically well informed cases. One method that is common among the first three conceptions of strategic culture and could be pursued by neoclassical realists is process tracing, involving \u2018\u2018theoretically informed historical research to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to an outcome\u2019\u2019. This methodology is not atheoretical, but recognizes that the complexity of the social world requires the researcher to examine a combination of several causal factors to explain any particular outcome. In so doing, the researcher traces the decision-making process leading to a particular outcome, but such a method can deal with complex forms of causality that identifies the outcome as flowing from \u2018\u2018the convergence of several conditions, independent variables or causal chains\u2019\u2019 . At the same time, researchers adopting such an approach do not assume \u2018\u2018a political universe characterized by the regularities which might render possible a predictive (albeit probabilistic) science of the political\u2019\u2019 . Rather than endeavor to emulate Waltzian neorealism in seeking to formulate a theory that can be applied universally, these researchers point \u2018\u2018to the inherent complexity and contingency (or open-endedness) of processes of change in which human subjects are involved\u2019\u2019 . Yet, there is a clear distinction here between conventional constructivists and post-structuralists. As pointed out earlier, the latter do not view the generation of generalizations\u2014even contingent ones\u2014as viable for their approach. They could engage in empirical case studies using trace processing in order to establish links between ideational factors and political outcomes. However, they view agency and the individual role of each actor in any given event in such a way that each \u2018\u2018concatenation of causal mechanisms'\u2019 is rarely if ever repeated. On the other hand, the conventional constructivists do seek to establish contingent generalizations concerning patterns of behavior by adopting a method that specifies independent variables, delineates them into the categories for which the researcher will measure the cases and their outcomes, and provides not only hypotheses on how these variables operate individually, but also contingent generalizations on how and under what circumstances they behave in specified conjunctions or configurations to produce effects on specified dependent variables. This \u2018\u2018allows for cross-case comparisons\u2044studies which can be integrated with within-case methods to allow structured iterations between theories and cases\u2019\u2019 . For example, Richard Price and Christian Reus-Smit  investigate the cultural context in which actors operate and thereby gain insights in to what they call \u2018\u2018contingent generalizations.\u2019\u2019 Such generalizations are not necessarily \u2018\u2018time less determinants of human social and political life,\u2019\u2019 they aim \u2018\u2018not to obscure\u2026cultural and historical particularities\u2019\u2019 and the \u2018\u2018factors they focus upon are not treated as context-free independent variables that may be transferred unproblematically to any and all situations to produce a necessary outcome\u2019\u2019 . Those that wish to limit themselves to making \u2018\u2018contingent generalizations\u2019\u2019 can still consistently claim that \u2018\u2018ideas, norms, and culture generate structures\u2019\u2019\u2014one can establish causality and generate certain generalizations about such causality without necessarily claiming that culture is immutable.", "metadata": "glenn- strategic culture&realism-cl.txt", "judgement": true}, "15": {"text": "There have been no similar attempts to articulate the nature and constituent elements of an Asia-Pacific strategic culture. There may not, in fact, be any such culture prevailing throughout this vast and disparate region. Rather, there are some important cultural and traditional factors which are common to Asian societies but which obtain to different extents and in different fashion in different countries and which have different implications for cooperative approaches to security in the region. Some of these factors rest their status more on myth than practical respect. None are absolute. And none are immutable. The principal (purported) elements of the Asia-Pacific strategic culture include longer time horizons and policy perspectives than those which characterise Western thinking and planning; reliance on bilateral rather than multilateral approaches to conflict resolution and security planning; an Asian way of war which places less emphasis on the holding of territory, and greater emphasis on the exercise of other forms of military, economic and cultural hegemony; commitment to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries; styles of policy making which feature informality of structures and modalities, form and process as much as substance and outcome, consensus rather than majority rule, and pragmatism rather than idealism; multidimensional or comprehensive approaches to security; and roles for the military that go beyond national defense to include politics, economic development and social affairs. Long-term Perspectives Asians tend to think in longer time frames than Westerners. The old Malay saying of \"lama-lama menjadi bukit,\" or \"it takes a long time to build a mountain,\" has analogous renditions throughout East and Southeast Asia. As Sukarno once stated, \"We, the Indonesian people, have learned not to think in centimeters or meters, not in hours or days. We have learned to think in continents and decades.\" Policymakers are generally not constrained by the three- or four-year election cycles which bedevil long-term planning in many Western states. But the attitude is much more fundamental than the product of different electoral systems. In part, it derives from a value system which places family or community interests ahead of the immediate satisfaction of individual material wants. Even more fundamentally, it derives from cultural perspectives which go back several thousand years - and in which periods of a few years or even decades lose significance. Mao Zedong once remarked wryly, \"In real life, we cannot ask for 'ever victorious' generals.\" Rather, there will be inevitable reversals which can be philosophically accepted in light of longer-term objectives. As K'ung Teh-cheng, Taiwan's leading Confucian scholar, has stated (with reference to the maintenance of the communist regime in China): \"35 or 40 years to a nation with a history of 5,000 years is nothing. It is a second on the clock. K'ung [Confucius] has been tested for 2,500 years and he is strong. Communism has been here for 40 years and it cannot survive.\" In other words, the security issues which are likely to be of most concern to regional leaders are those which have the potential to disrupt broader, longer-term objectives such as political stability and social harmony rather than more particular or immediate issues which are the day-to-day fare of Western security planners. Mechanisms for addressing these longer-term issues are more important than new institutional arrangements or quick fixes for dealing with less abiding issues. Asian Conceptions of War and Strategy War, as Ken Booth has argued most cogently, is \"a cultural phenomenon\" (if not a \"cultural disease\"). Its purposes and modalities - that is, the strategies for the conduct of war - are strongly affected by social and cultural factors, roles for the military that go beyond national defense to include politics, economic development, and social affairs. In general, Asian conceptions of war and strategy are broader and more profound than Western conceptions in several important respects. To begin with, Western concepts of war are \"rooted in the European nation-state idea,\" whereas some of the fundamental aspects of Asian concepts pre-dated nation building in Asia and remain attuned to sub-state and supra-state forces, and especially revolutionary forces, as much as states. Second, Western concepts tend to be more instrumental, concentrating more on techniques rather than the basic causes and dynamics of conflict. Third, Western concepts of war employ a narrow definition of war, excluding not merely a multitude of lesser conflicts such as \"domestic\" and \"communal\" conflicts but also the violence perpetrated on local populations, often to the detriment of broader strategic objectives. Fourth, the concepts of \"strategy\" and \"tactics\" are operationally defined at higher levels than the respective Western notions, with strategy being concerned with the broad capabilities and methods of maneuvering the enemy, actual or potential, into a position of being unable to counter foreign policy offensives, while tactics concerns the actual way an enemy is attacked after he is placed in such a disadvantageous position. (In other words, Asian concepts of strategy pertain more to what Western strategic thinkers term \"grand strategy\" and tactics more to \"military strategy\" rather than the particular means of battlefield operations.) As Sun Tzu wrote around 400 BCE, the supreme art of war is \"to subdue the enemy without fighting.\" Strategy is concerned with the pursuit of national objectives and interests rather than the means of achieving victory on the battlefield. Hence, fifth, the military aspects of strategy (such as relative numerical strengths and weapons systems) are less important than political factors such as unity and stability on the home front and such intangibles as morale and mental skills. Attacking the mind of the enemy is far more important than the mechanics of physical clashes. As Sun Tzu wrote, \"weapons are ominous tools to be used only when there is no alternative.\" Sixth, the object of military action is not the holding or taking of territory, the annihilation of the enemy's army, the destruction of his cities or the wastage of his countryside. As Sun Tzu wrote, \"Do not put a premium on killing.... To capture the enemy's army is better than to destroy it... The worst policy is to attack cities. Attack cities only when there is no alternative.\" And as Mao Zedong wrote in 1947, \"do not make holding or seizing a city or place our main objective.\" Seventh, the concepts of offense and defense are both fungible and complementary rather than alternative strategies. Mao Zedong paraphrased Sun Tzu as follows: Attack may be changed into defense and defense into attack; advance may be turned into retreat and retreat into advance; containing forces may be turned into assault forces, and assault forces into containing forces.\"", "metadata": "ball-strategic culture in asia pacific-cleaned.txt", "judgement": true}, "16": {"text": "Whereas respondents who subscribe to either belief system would accordingly agree about the critical importance of military strength, those with more Confucian beliefs would be less likely to see war as moral and, perhaps, to consider it quite as permissible to attain the same goals. This would contribute to the observed variation in strategic preferences and endorsed behavior that, while still generally militaristic, correlated with stated worldviews and normative beliefs across the spectrum. In this way, nationalism functioned as a culturally- contextual perception of cultural history, international image, and national identity that contributed to \u201cirrational\u201d deviations between \u201chow the mind works and how it should work.\u201d The use of a strategic culture construct that omitted nationalism also was one likely reason why the widely-accepted paradigmatic axioms of Confucian and realist theory were found to be only moderately strong measures of actual worldviews. Beliefs about the character of the international system and state behavior in it certainly include the extent to which it is seen as anarchic, zero-sum, power politics where war is likely and effective - but it is equally logical that they are also shaped by perceptions of whether the status quo system specifically seeks to marginalize China and to deny it its right to territorial integrity and sovereignty. The use of two survey versions in order to vary the state which respondents considered allowed for this to be tested. Nationalism, by nature, is based on \u201ca common agenda for unity and identity\u201d derived from belonging to same state . The component beliefs of nationalism and the resulting emotional content which affects their degree of influence, accordingly, are specific to the citizens of that state. The importance of shared identity is further highlighted because the relational nature of nationalism involves \u201cexplicit comparisons between highly value in-group traits and the devaluation of out-groups . As would be expected if nationalist beliefs were a significant influence on strategic decision making but were not applicable for respondents considering a foreign state, the reliability of the Views of IR latent factor \u2013 which indicated how well the indicators measured their latent factor - was notably stronger for the Chinese students thinking of other states than those thinking of their own . It was likely that the partiality of nationalism was also at least partially responsible for respondents giving substantially greater permissibility for when and how their own country ought to and can use force than for other countries. Furthermore, the way in which nationalism shapes strategic preferences and decision- making is unique to each nation because it is the differences of each nation\u2019s characteristic beliefs that define it. Though the name implies that these are differences between traditional nation-states, China\u2019s beliefs about its cultural history, international image, and national identity cannot be separated from its culture . This stands in strong contrast to the component beliefs of strategic culture, where the inevitability of war, the \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cthreat\u201d of the \u201cadversary,\u201d and the \u201cefficacy of the use of force\u201d may come from cultural or structural sources \u2013 or both. Not only are any of these possibilities plausible but it is very difficult to determine which one was the source. The legitimacy of the postulated cultural or structural influence on what is \u201crational\u201d depends upon its ability to uniquely and comprehensively explain deviations from behavior predicted by realist theory. Prior studies have little choice but rely on either structurally or culturally-specific factors for reconciliation. Because Chinese nationalism is a unique amalgamation of Chinese culture, if it is indeed the cause of at least some of the unexplained covariance, it serves as strong evidence that the respondent\u2019s strategic preferences and decisions were more strongly influenced by cultural factors than structural ones. Moreover, if true, then nationalism, as a conveyor of strategic culture, would further homogenize elite and normal citizen\u2019s beliefs about the use force. Lastly, it could be that the strategic preferences and foreign policy of respondents were shaped not just by nationalist beliefs but also by beliefs of Chinese exceptionalism. These concepts are closely related but differ in that exceptionalism contains the assumption that the country or culture possesses certain characteristics that make it uniquely better than all others . Especially because this concept \u201chas long been written [about] as though exceptionalism were all of the American type or a variant of it,\u201d it is useful to briefly compare how American and Chinese exceptionalism have been characterized . Walt describes American exceptionalism as the belief that American \u201cvalues, political system, and history are unique and worthy of universal admiration\u201d so America is \u201cboth destined and entitled to play a distinct and positive role on the world stage\u201d . Addressing the possibility of Chinese exceptionalism, Zhang states, If by exceptionalism is meant the unique qualities \u2014 from the particular set of political and social values to the special historical trajectory and foreign relations experience \u2014 that differentiate one country from another, then China certainly has its own version of exceptionalism\u2026because China is a rising great power, the specific character and quality of its exceptionalism matter more than those of most other countries\u201c Not so different than the American concept of Manifest Destiny, China\u2019s sense of unique \u201cgreatness\u201d derives from its large geography and population as well as its conception as the Central Kingdom, \u201cchosen by Heaven\u201d to be at the top of the political hierarchy, and who\u2019s culture embodies the definition of civilization . Whereas the American version further claims that being endowed with \u201cunique responsibilities\u201d that are \u201cdifferent from other powers and that these differences require them to take on special burdens\u201d , Zhang avers that, through \u201cofficial and semi-official statements,\u201d China\u2019s government and elites, \u201chaving established imperial China\u2019s pacifist tradition, emphasized China\u2019s agonizing experience in the modern world, and professed China\u2019s intention to never inflict similar sufferings on other countries, the PRC claims that it will always adopt a peaceful foreign policy, will never threaten anyone, and will help to maintain world peace through its own development\u201d . Despite such pledges, much of this language is strikingly similar to Walt\u2019s description that \u201cAmerican exceptionalism rest on the belief that the United States is a uniquely virtuous nation, one that loves peace...Americans like to think their country behaves much better than other states do, and certainly better than other great powers\u201d . As it would be \u201cat best inappropriate and at worst self-humiliating\u201d for China to follow the Western model of great power politics , instead it emphasizes \u201cgreat power reformism, benevolent pacifism, and harmonious inclusionism\u201d as the basis of an \u201cethical system as the solution to the problems of the current international system\u201d .", "metadata": "dis_ch7_1.txt", "judgement": true}, "17": {"text": "Xi's much-touted campaign to eliminate absolute poverty\u2020 in China is a prominent example of the involvement of these commissions in disciplining lower-level decision-makers and implementers.

While this exceeded the World Bank's extreme poverty threshold of $1.90 in 2011 dollars, economists have argued that the standard is nevertheless too low for a country with China's aggregate wealth.

In October 2021, the CCP Central Committee announced it would undertake a series of disciplinary inspections into China's financial regulators, state-owned banks, and major financial institutions, with a statement from the CCDI describing the inspections as part of an effort to \"strengthen the Party's leadership of financial work.\"181 The probe began as questions about China's high debt levels and inability to shift toward its \"high-quality\" growth model came into sharper relief for China's leaders: the 2021 CCDI investigation was notable for its inclusion of China's state-owned asset management companies, such as China Huarong.182 The firm's chairman, Lai Xiaomin, was executed following his conviction on bribery charges in January 2021.183 Lai's execution was followed by Huarong missing a deadline to release its 2020 Annual Report in April 2021, further rattling China's financial markets.*184 Asset management companies were not scrutinized in a prior round of CCDI inspections into China's financial sector in 2015.\u2020185 Hugely indebted property developer Evergrande's missed bond payments in September and October 2021 likely also animated Party concerns about ties between nonstate companies and state-owned lenders.\u2021186 *A host of other factors likely contributed to the Party's concerns about Huarong and its ability to dispose of nonperforming loans (NPLs). Huarong is one of the original four asset management companies established by the Chinese government in 1999 to take NPLs off the balance sheets of the country's state-owned banks amid the government's broader bailout of them at the time. Beginning in 2006, Huarong expanded into several other lines of noncore business, including banking, brokerage, and fund management services, as well as lending to property developers, thereby departing from its original mandate of helping state-owned banks dispose of NPLs and growing in systemic importance.

Around the period of China's Reform and Opening, the prominence and discretion of local implementation increased sizably.\u2020 As Dr. Teets argued in testimony before the Commission, the great strength of this model was the adaptability it afforded an otherwise rigid authoritarian state. Local governments were able to compete, innovate, and move quickly to encourage GDP growth.130 The problem CCP leaders perceived, however, was that their formal control over economic decision-making had eroded. Halting attempts to adjust the growth model under the Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao Administration highlighted conflicts between the central government, local governments, and emerging corporate class.131 Inability to push forward central directives also revealed the relative decline of Party control mechanisms as well as rampant corruption and state capture by networks of regime insiders.132 Vested interest groups across various sectors (e.g., real estate, infrastructure, finance, and energy) and geographic areas developed centers of power challenging Beijing. Characterized by informal patronage and loyalty networks, these blocs proved capable of influencing national politics and stymying central government initiatives in favor of parochial interests.\u2021 While this collusion between local governments and business may have fostered China's rapid growth, it undermined the effectiveness of central governance, often requiring Beijing to bargain informally with influential interest groups in exchange for compliance with top-level decisions.133 As vested interests undermined *As Neil Thomas explained in testimony before the Commission, \"For Xi, political power also has a policy purpose.
