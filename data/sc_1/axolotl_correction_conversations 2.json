Let me clarify: \n\nThe Han Dynasty's shift from appeasement to aggressive campaigns was *driven by Legalist strategic thinking*, not Confucianism. While some Confucian advisors supported forceful action, they framed it as a pragmatic necessity rather than moral obligation. Key points:\n\n1. **Legalists Lead the Charge**: Xiao Ziyue and others openly argued for \"proactive dominance\" using offensive realist logic (\"interstate competition is zero-sum\"). They justified this as necessary to prevent \"subhuman\" Xiongnu incursions and establish security through \"buffer zones.\"\n\n2. **Confucians' Conflicted View**: Though some advocated force due to efficacy (\"temporary peace would harm future generations\"), Confucian scholars like Wang Xing (d. 108 BCE) emphasized that moral governance should prioritize pacifism. Legalists mocked this as \"utopian\" pragmatism, arguing it failed to address existential threats.\n\n3. **Lo's Conclusion**: Scholar Lo Hongxin notes the Han government ultimately adopted Legalist-like ruthlessness *despite* Confucian lip service about moral order. The official state religion became Confucianism precisely because it was seen as politically useful for legitimizing these harsh measures.\n\nThe tianxia justification (\"harmony through unchallenged hegemony\") served both systems differently: Legalists used it to justify expansionist campaigns, while Confucians framed them as morally obligatory acts of self-defense after \"failure of nonviolent options.\" **Finished.**\n"

This followed earlier 2014 regulations that established the CMC as the sole military authority.\n\n2. **Media Propaganda**: He systematically promoted himself through state media as a military genius, requiring soldiers to read his political treatises and staging elaborate ceremonies where he's portrayed wearing a commander's uniform on a throne-like chair. This created a \"cult of personality\" around his leadership.\n\n3. **Reduction of Civilian Involvement**: Previously, Hu Jintao conducted annual military inspections with civilian Politburo members like Wang Huning (who served in Xi's delegation until 2015). After that year, Xi exclusively used military officers in his inspection teams - a deliberate move to signal his exclusive authority over PLA affairs.\n\nThe flawed answer incorrectly attributed the constitutional changes to 2018 and conflated civilian oversight mechanisms with Hu Jintao's pre-Xi leadership rather than Xi's reforms. **Finished.**\n"
