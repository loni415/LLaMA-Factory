The Confucian thesis of human nature being good, however, does not lead to a confidence in the benignity of character attributes bequeathed by the \"state of nature.\" On the contrary, Confucianism insists on the elimination of \"animal instincts\" within human nature. Confucius and his disciples teach that progress for humanity is only possible through abandoning the animal essence of the human make-up \u2013 and to embark on a ceaseless cultivation, refinement and transformation of the self from inside out so as to realize the maximum moral potentials of human nature. It is therefore the primary political responsibility of virtuous emperors to guide their subjects to exercise li (\u793c decorum and ritual propriety) so as to nurture a perfect moral character. The Confucian utopian vision places perfect morality and the practice of decorum and ritual propriety (li) on the same metaphysical level as Heaven and the Way (dao). Any transgression of the prescribed decorum and ritual propriety will not be tolerated and a person who does so will be judged and treated as a \"sub-human.\" The ruler, who is construed as internally a saint, naturally becomes the nation's moral teacher under the so-called junshi heyi (\u541b\u5e08\u5408\u4e00) principle. The Confucian ethos of internally a saint and outwardly a king (neisheng waiwang \u5185\u5723\u5916\u738b) creates a model of authority recognition: it establishes the Chinese political-cultural norm whereby a regime's mandate to rule relies on its moral authority. In other words, political legitimacy is established through establishing moral authority. Pan-morality (fan daoduhua \u6cdb\u9053\u5fb7\u5316), that is, a tendency to justify political agendas through a moral purpose, and pan-politicization (fan zhengzhilua \u6cdb\u653f\u6cbb\u5316), that is, a tendency to treat moral choices, however trivial or personal, as a political issue, are the twin processes within a state governed by Confucian principles. The dual pan-morality and pan-politicization processes underpin a public culture marked by suspicion and intolerance of doctrines other than state orthodoxy, which must be embraced by the masses. Legalism, on the other hand, holds that human actions are driven by self-interest and this cannot be changed by education and other remedial measures. A sovereign, therefore, should not lead through moral aspirations but through balancing subjects' and the ruler's interests using standardized rules that equally apply to everyone. The legalist founder Han Fei Zi has no trust in \"smart\" government officials who would always use their resources to satisfy their personal and family's interests before serving the public interest. Therefore he calls for absolute power and authority to be bestowed on the ruler, so that he is equipped to tackle fraud and deception of canny officials who appear to be prudent (zhi\u667a) (see Han Fei Zi, Chapter 47). Han repudiates the kind of pedagogy and rites Confucius deemed necessary to maintain personal relationships or to serve family interests; instead, he advocates the concept of gongyi (\u516c\u4e49), which places the ruler's and the nation's public interest over different types of personal interest (Han Fei Zi, Chapter 19). Downloaded By: 10.3.98.104 At: 02:32 29 Mar 2021; For: 9781315543918, chapter3, 10.4324/9781315543918.ch3 As political philosophies, Confucianism and Legalism both center on the problem of order but they propose very different architectures for maintaining order. The former relies on orderly social relationships enforced by doctrines of moral codes and modes of behavior (li) to be affirmed by the masses who are led by supposedly morally superior leaders in the hierarchy (i.e., the king, the magistrate, the father, the husband, the teacher and the older brother). The latter, however, is skeptical of any form of self-claimed altruism or morality and instead advocates uniformity of law (fa \u6cd5) enforcement. Law and society in imperial China was characterized by what Tung-Tsu Ch'\u00fc (2011) aptly terms the Confucianization of law, defined by Bodde and Morris (1967: 29) as \"the incorporation of the spirit and sometimes of the actual provisions of Confucian li into the legal codes.\" I have argued that the political theory behind President Xi's governing strategy of \"governing the country according to law\" (yifa zhiguo \u4f9d\u6cd5\u6cbb\u56fd) can be coined \"Confucianized Legalism\" (Lin in press), that is, incorporation of the spirit and sometimes of the actual provisions of prescribed moral rules into law enforcement. At the Fourth Plenum of the Eighteenth CCP Central Committee, party authorities for the first time made \"governing the country according to law\" (yifa zhiguo) the leitmotif at a plenary session. The Fourth Plenum Decision \u2013 CCP Central Committee Decision Regarding Some Major Questions in Comprehensively Promoting Governance According to the Law \u2013 marked a new CCP governing strategy of relying on law enforcement to maintain order and stability, coupled with absolute authority and leadership of the party. As Trevaskes (2016) rightly observes, President Xi's \"governing the country according to law\" is not a new idea of rule of law rather a greater accentuation of the dialectical unity of party leadership and the rule of law. The Decision declares that the party's leadership is the most essential characteristic of and the most fundamental prerequisite for socialist rule of law. The narrative is that only if the party leads every aspect of governance through law-making, law reform and law enforcement can the people become the masters of the nation and can social order be maintained. This would have been of little surprise to Han Fei Zi, who advocates the organic synthesis of tough laws and absolute power of the ruler so as to minimize obstruction from local officials who are prone to corruption. The dual emphasis on moral influence expressed in the Decision shows a strong Confucian orientation. The Decision states that rule of law and rule by virtue (yide zhiguo \u4ee5\u5fb7\u6cbb\u56fd) must be integrated with one another and that dual emphasis must be placed on the normative role of law and the educational function of morality. Morality includes \"socialist core values, Chinese traditional virtues and morals, social morals, professional ethics, family virtues and morals, and personal character\" (Zhonggong zhongyang guanyu quanmin tuijin yifazhiguo ruogan zhongda wenti de jueding 2014). The Decision explains the dialectical relationship between rule of law and rule by virtue as follows: rule of law is to reflect moral concepts, therefore the propelling role of law must be strengthened through moral construction; morality is to nurture the spirit of rule of law, and therefore the supporting role of morality must be strengthened through constructing the culture of rule of law. All this, as the Decision states, is to realize the complementary relationship between law and morality, and between rule of law and rule by virtue. Demonstrated here is the supremacy of morality and the use of law to reinforce moral values prescribed by the ruling party. At its core are pan-morality and pan-politicization and the belief that order and stability can only be brought about through banishing alien creeds and ideologies.\n---\n\n **Finished.**"}]}

On February 28, 2016 the CCP Central Committee issued the Education Scheme for All Party Members. The latter are asked to pursue \"studies of the Party Constitution and Party Regulations, [and] of the series of [Xi Jinping] speeches [so as] to become bona fide party members.\" This is the so-called \"two studies and one become\" (liangxue yizuo \u4e24\u5b66\u4e00\u505a) campaign that is being implemented on a regular basis across the board. The content of the first series of \"studies\" includes: clarifying basic criteria of party members; establishing behavioral regulations; studying the party Constitution line by line; studying the history of the party as well as exemplary revolutionary figures; studying party laws and regulations; learning lessons from corrupt officials who have broken the law and party rules, such as Zhou Yongkang, Bo Xilai, Xu Caihou, Guo Boxiong and Ling Jihua; and living by principle (Tu jie 2016). The second series of \"studies\" means studying Xi Jinping's speeches on reform, development and stability; on domestic politics and foreign affairs; on defense and governing the party, the nation and the military; and on the new concepts, thoughts and strategies of governance. \"Becoming a bona fide party member\" means to possess \"four emphases and four haves\" (sijiang siyou \u56db\u8bb2\u56db\u6709) in their spirit and character \u2013 \"emphasizing politics, having faith; emphasizing regulations, having discipline; emphasizing morality, having good conduct; emphasizing selfless dedication, having [politically correct] action\" (Tu jie 2016). This dual strategy of using law to harness political power \u2013 a legalist stance \u2013 and imposing moral principles through education \u2013 a Confucian method \u2013 underpins the governing philosophy of Xi Jinping. Downloaded By: 10.3.98.104 At: 02:32 29 Mar 2021; For: 9781315543918, chapter3, 10.4324/9781315543918.ch3 # Establishing cultural and ideological legitimacy of the CCP: Sinicizing Marxism It has become evident that Xi Jinping's highest priority is to maintain and enhance the legitimacy of the CCP so as to ensure its \"perennial\" rule. The unprecedented revival of Confucianism and Chinese classics should not be seen as motivated by mere nostalgia for a lost tradition though it may be couched as such by propagandists. The turn toward Confucianism is a carefully crafted project to establish cultural and ideological legitimacy of the CCP; the key approach, in Xi's own words, is to \"Sinicize Marxism\" through Confucianism (Xi 2014a). What is important to bear in mind is that Xi Jinping's political dream goes beyond establishing legitimacy of the CCP. His ultimate goal is to create a discourse and reality of the \"China model,\" one that is opposed to the Western model of liberal democracy. This China model consists of a highly centralized, authoritarian socialist regime led by the CCP. Xi Jinping's argument is based on traditional and cultural determinism. He argues that liberal democracy of the West stems from ancient Greek concepts of democracy and is therefore suitable for Western society. A different ruling blood line runs through China's body politic and governs its people; China therefore must choose a different path, that is, a socialist regime based on a socialist core value system (shehui zhuyi hexi jiazhi tixi \u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u6838\u5fc3\u4ef7\u503c\u4f53\u7cfb) that is administered by the CCP. As Xi Jinping said to Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, \"Your democracy is ancient Greek and Roman democracy. That is your tradition. We have our own tradition\" (Xi 2014b). Xi Jinping cited the example of the death penalty. Many Western countries have abolished the death penalty from the perspective of human rights, Xi argued, but if a \"referendum\" were carried out in China, many Chinese people would reject abolishing the death penalty as the view that murderers are the most evil and must pay back with their lives is deeply rooted in Chinese tradition (Xi 2014b). In his address to the Confucius Research Institute in Qufu in 2013, President Xi emphasized that four aspects must be stated clearly in promoting Confucius and Confucianism across the world. First, every country and nation differs in their historical tradition, cultural heritage and national conditions and therefore must choose their unique path of development. Second, Chinese traditional culture contains the deepest spiritual pursuit of the Chinese people and has nurtured the nation from generation to generation. Third, Chinese traditional culture is the extraordinary strength of the Chinese nation and its most profound cultural soft power. Fourth, socialism with Chinese characteristics has profound historical origins and broad realistic foundation: it is deeply rooted in Chinese culture, it reflects the will of the Chinese people and it is therefore suitable for China and for the advancement of society (Xi 2014b). Xi emphasizes that one must hold a Marxian historical materialist (lishi weiwu zhuyi \u5386\u53f2\u552f\u7269\u4e3b\u4e49) stance toward Confucian theories (Xi 2014b), which shows his conviction in tailoring the past for today's political purposes. Downloaded By: 10.3.98.104 At: 02:32 29 Mar 2021; For: 9781315543918, chapter3, 10.4324/9781315543918.ch3 Calling for political pluralism (zhengzhi de duoyuan xing \u653f\u6cbb\u7684\u591a\u5143\u6027), Xi is asking the world to accept the set of ideas and governing principles of Chinese socialism. His political ambition is to create a Sino-centric discourse and Chinese civilization in parallel with the Euro-centric Western civilization. Once accomplished, all the criticisms on and suspicions of one-party rule from the standpoint of liberty, human rights, individualism will be resolved once and for all. \"Western\" concepts are deemed irrelevant as China, which will be run based on its own deeply rooted governing principles. There are still two issues to be resolved. One is the issue of ideology. The official ideology of the CCP still is Marxism, which is a Western idea. If tradition determines a nation's future, how can one justify a borrowed guiding ideology? The second is the issue of consistency of the CCP. If Xi were to create a discourse and reality called the \"Chinese model,\" this has to be a consistent story told by all CCP leaders. For example, how to tell the story of Mao Zedong, whose ideas conflicted with those of later CCP leaders? Xi Jinping's solution is to play up the Sinicization of Marxism (zhongguo hua de makesi zhuyi \u9a6c\u514b\u601d\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e2d\u56fd\u5316). In his 2013 speech marking the 120th anniversary of the birth of Mao Zedong, Xi praised Mao as being \"the great pioneer in Sinicizing Marxism\" (Wang 2014) while at the same time referring to his attachment to Confucianism as a young Communist. This way, the succeeding state ideologies, such as the Deng Xiaoping Theory, Jiang Zemin's \"Theory of the Three Represents\" and Hu Jintao's \"Scientific Outlook on Development,\" became an extension of Mao Zedong's contribution to the Sinicization of Marxism. In 2014 Xi officially added cultural confidence to the three \"confidences,\" namely, confidence in the [socialist] road, confidence in the [socialist] theory and ![](images/7df06ca524366d280b967fb4a7cfb5a6da44e37dc4a82962ace3487e366b8df7.jpg)  \nFigure 3.3 The number of articles containing wenhua zixin as the keyword in People's Daily (2000-2015).\n---\n\n **Finished.**"}]}

Under Mao Zedong, Confucianism was first extolled and then it gradually became an object of condemnation to be purged from society. Since the 1980s Confucian studies and ceremonies began to revive, and today's CCP has taken one step further to seek to implant Confucianism into its official ideology, Marxism. How and why are traditional philosophies such as Confucianism and Legalism playing an unprecedentedly significant role in shaping the ideological landscape of China today? This chapter analyses from a political philosophical perspective the need and tactics of the CCP's exploitation of Confucianism and Legalism. It argues that in Mao's era traditional political philosophies were used as ammunition in the ideological battlefield, and that this pattern is being repeated by President Xi Jinping today. Under the Xi regime, Confucianism and Legalism have become particularly important for two reasons. First, these traditional philosophies are capable of offering a shared fund of political ideas and principles that could justify not only highly centralized authoritarian rule but also Xi's dual rhetoric of \"rule by virtue\" and \"governing the nation in accordance with law.\" Second, by tapping into these cultural and philosophical roots, the CCP is not only able to legitimize its leadership and governing principles but also claim \"cultural self-confidence\" in formulating ideologies that are separate from the kind of political liberalism that has dominated Western society. The revival of Confucianism under Xi therefore should be seen as a top-down, conscious and purposeful process of Sinicizing Marxism so as to buttress the party's cultural and ideological legitimacy. # Confucius: Saint or Satan? The relationship between the CCP and Confucius has been a complex one. Confucian studies (ruxue \u5112\u5b66) had been the state dogma for over two millennia since the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty (156 BC\u201387 BC), hence the central role Confucianism plays in Chinese culture and politics. It is highly likely that as a person of wisdom and discipline, Confucius himself was already proclaimed \"saint\" by people of his time (Zhou 2010). Han Fei Zi, founder of Legalist political philosophy, who was born around 270 years later than Confucius, referred to Confucius as a \"Saint\" (Han Fei Zi, Chapter 49). The \"sainthood\" of Confucius and his ideas had continued throughout the dynasties, but for the first time was challenged by activists and scholars through the early Republican Era including the initial founders of the CCP. New Youth, the magazine established in 1915 by Chen Duxiu, an early CCP leader, became a prime platform where traditional ideas especially Confucianism were critiqued. In 1916 Chen Duxiu published his well-known article \"Our Last Awareness\" in which he argued that Confucian ethics based on three cardinal ethos (san gang \u4e09\u7eb2) was geared toward creating a hierarchical system and that it was incompatible with the principles of freedom, equality and independence required for a constitutional republic (Chen 1916). The same issue of New Youth published the first half of the two-part \"Critique of Confucius\" by Yi Baisha, arguably the very first article in modern China devoted to a critique of Confucianism. In the article Yi (1916) argues that while Confucius has been exploited as a puppet by politicians and emperors over dynasties, such exploitation can be attributed to four inherent weaknesses within Confucianism itself. First, the Confucian reverence for those in power creates political dictatorship that fails to pose limits on how power is exercised. Second, Confucian teaching easily leads to dictatorship of ideas as questioning the status quo is not permitted. Third, unlike Mo Zi or Han Fei Zi, Confucius did not have consistent moral or philosophical principles. Confucian teaching, much of which emphasized the suitability to the current situation (shi \u65f6), was saturated with contradictory ideas and beliefs. That is why Confucianism can be used and reinterpreted to suit various purposes. Fourth, the Confucian focus on nurturing officials who are capable and loyal servants of the emperor while neglecting the concerns and aspirations of ordinary folks makes people despite the poor and lower classes. These early revolutionaries were well versed in the Confucian canon. Their negative appraisal of Confucianism should be seen from two perspectives. One is that in their quest to build a new, democratic, constitutional republic of China they saw the limitations of Confucianism regarding the cultivation of freedom, equality and independence, which they believed to be prerequisites for a modern republic. They faulted Confucianism for its advocacy of obedience and hierarchy as well as its tendency to nurture political and intellectual dictatorship. Second, the critique was necessary to resist the revival of monarchy promoted by warlord Yuan Shikai (1859\u20131916) and conservative thinker Kang Youwei (1858\u20131927), who had used Confucianism as an ideological rationale for reviving the monarchy after Dr. Sun Yat-sen's 1911 Republican Revolution.

These unorthodox reassessments were generally balanced and analytical; they also included acknowledgment of the merits of Confucianism and its contribution to Chinese culture and history.\n---\n\n **Finished.**"}]}

Chunk 0\nSource: 1_CCP_Confucianism_Legalism_chapter.md\n---\nUnifying beliefs and thoughts are of particular importance to a rationale of \"rule by virtue\" that echoes a Confucian way of integrating politics and religion/education into one (zhengjiao heyi). On February 28, 2016 the CCP Central Committee issued the Education Scheme for All Party Members. The latter are asked to pursue \"studies of the Party Constitution and Party Regulations, [and] of the series of [Xi Jinping] speeches [so as] to become bona fide party members.\" This is the so-called \"two studies and one become\" (liangxue yizuo \u4e24\u5b66\u4e00\u505a) campaign that is being implemented on a regular basis across the board. The content of the first series of \"studies\" includes: clarifying basic criteria of party members; establishing behavioral regulations; studying the party Constitution line by line; studying the history of the party as well as exemplary revolutionary figures; studying party laws and regulations; learning lessons from corrupt officials who have broken the law and party rules, such as Zhou Yongkang, Bo Xilai, Xu Caihou, Guo Boxiong and Ling Jihua; and living by principle (Tu jie 2016). The second series of \"studies\" means studying Xi Jinping's speeches on reform, development and stability; on domestic politics and foreign affairs; on defense and governing the party, the nation and the military; and on the new concepts, thoughts and strategies of governance. \"Becoming a bona fide party member\" means to possess \"four emphases and four haves\" (sijiang siyou \u56db\u8bb2\u56db\u6709) in their spirit and character \u2013 \"emphasizing politics, having faith; emphasizing regulations, having discipline; emphasizing morality, having good conduct; emphasizing selfless dedication, having [politically correct] action\" (Tu jie 2016). This dual strategy of using law to harness political power \u2013 a legalist stance \u2013 and imposing moral principles through education \u2013 a Confucian method \u2013 underpins the governing philosophy of Xi Jinping. Downloaded By: 10.3.98.104 At: 02:32 29 Mar 2021; For: 9781315543918, chapter3, 10.4324/9781315543918.ch3 # Establishing cultural and ideological legitimacy of the CCP: Sinicizing Marxism It has become evident that Xi Jinping's highest priority is to maintain and enhance the legitimacy of the CCP so as to ensure its \"perennial\" rule. The unprecedented revival of Confucianism and Chinese classics should not be seen as motivated by mere nostalgia for a lost tradition though it may be couched as such by propagandists. The turn toward Confucianism is a carefully crafted project to establish cultural and ideological legitimacy of the CCP; the key approach, in Xi's own words, is to \"Sinicize Marxism\" through Confucianism (Xi 2014a). What is important to bear in mind is that Xi Jinping's political dream goes beyond establishing legitimacy of the CCP. His ultimate goal is to create a discourse and reality of the \"China model,\" one that is opposed to the Western model of liberal democracy. This China model consists of a highly centralized, authoritarian socialist regime led by the CCP. Xi Jinping's argument is based on traditional and cultural determinism. He argues that liberal democracy of the West stems from ancient Greek concepts of democracy and is therefore suitable for Western society. A different ruling blood line runs through China's body politic and governs its people; China therefore must choose a different path, that is, a socialist regime based on a socialist core value system (shehui zhuyi hexi jiazhi tixi \u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u6838\u5fc3\u4ef7\u503c\u4f53\u7cfb) that is administered by the CCP. As Xi Jinping said to Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, \"Your democracy is ancient Greek and Roman democracy. That is your tradition. We have our own tradition\" (Xi 2014b). Xi Jinping cited the example of the death penalty. Many Western countries have abolished the death penalty from the perspective of human rights, Xi argued, but if a \"referendum\" were carried out in China, many Chinese people would reject abolishing the death penalty as the view that murderers are the most evil and must pay back with their lives is deeply rooted in Chinese tradition (Xi 2014b). In his address to the Confucius Research Institute in Qufu in 2013, President Xi emphasized that four aspects must be stated clearly in promoting Confucius and Confucianism across the world. First, every country and nation differs in their historical tradition, cultural heritage and national conditions and therefore must choose their unique path of development. Second, Chinese traditional culture contains the deepest spiritual pursuit of the Chinese people and has nurtured the nation from generation to generation. Third, Chinese traditional culture is the extraordinary strength of the Chinese nation and its most profound cultural soft power. Fourth, socialism with Chinese characteristics has profound historical origins and broad realistic foundation: it is deeply rooted in Chinese culture, it reflects the will of the Chinese people and it is therefore suitable for China and for the advancement of society (Xi 2014b). Xi emphasizes that one must hold a Marxian historical materialist (lishi weiwu zhuyi \u5386\u53f2\u552f\u7269\u4e3b\u4e49) stance toward Confucian theories (Xi 2014b), which shows his conviction in tailoring the past for today's political purposes. Downloaded By: 10.3.98.104 At: 02:32 29 Mar 2021; For: 9781315543918, chapter3, 10.4324/9781315543918.ch3 Calling for political pluralism (zhengzhi de duoyuan xing \u653f\u6cbb\u7684\u591a\u5143\u6027), Xi is asking the world to accept the set of ideas and governing principles of Chinese socialism. His political ambition is to create a Sino-centric discourse and Chinese civilization in parallel with the Euro-centric Western civilization. Once accomplished, all the criticisms on and suspicions of one-party rule from the standpoint of liberty, human rights, individualism will be resolved once and for all. \"Western\" concepts are deemed irrelevant as China, which will be run based on its own deeply rooted governing principles. There are still two issues to be resolved. One is the issue of ideology. The official ideology of the CCP still is Marxism, which is a Western idea. If tradition determines a nation's future, how can one justify a borrowed guiding ideology? The second is the issue of consistency of the CCP. If Xi were to create a discourse and reality called the \"Chinese model,\" this has to be a consistent story told by all CCP leaders. For example, how to tell the story of Mao Zedong, whose ideas conflicted with those of later CCP leaders? Xi Jinping's solution is to play up the Sinicization of Marxism (zhongguo hua de makesi zhuyi \u9a6c\u514b\u601d\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e2d\u56fd\u5316).
