The text describes Mao\u2019s early admiration for Confucius, his later ideological opposition during the Cultural Revolution, and the eventual government-endorsed revival of Confucianism in modern China.  \n\nFrom *The Annotated Bibliography Of Chinese Studies (CCCSH)*, we know that Mao initially revered Confucius, calling him a \"great thinker\" alongside historical figures like Buddha and Jesus Christ. He advocated blending Marxism with traditional Chinese thought, including Confucian principles.  \n\nA critical pivot occurred during the Cultural Revolution, when Mao condemned Confucius as an \"idealist\" and a defender of aristocracy and slave ownership. He framed Confucianism as politically dangerous, targeting it alongside liberalism and other ideologies he opposed.  \n\nPost-Mao, however, the text notes a resurgence in Confucian promotion\u2014Confucius Institutes, Harmonious Society initiatives, and renewed official support for Confucian culture, which Mao\u2019s own later critiques had denounced as reactionary.  \n\n*Answer:*  \nMao Zedong\u2019s relationship with Confucius evolved dramatically over time:  \n1. **Early Admiration (1917\u2013Early 1930s):** Mao idolized Confucius, paralleling him with spiritual and political luminaries like Buddha and Jesus. He sought to fuse Marxism with Confucian heritage for China\u2019s revolution.  \n2. **Cultural Revolution (Late 1960s\u2013Early 1970s):** Mao sharply condemned Confucius, labeling him an \"idealist\" and champion of the elite classes. He branded Confucianism a political threat, aligning it with \"liberalism\" as a capitalist-bourgeois ideology.  \n3. **Post-Mao Era (1980s\u2013Present):** The Chinese government\u2014echoing Mao\u2019s earlier call to blend Western and Eastern thought\u2014has revived Confucianism as state culture, running institutes globally and linking it to \"Harmonious Society\" governance.  \n\nThis trajectory reflects Mao\u2019s changing political needs: from leveraging Confucius during early revolutionary days, to demonizing him as the enemy during power struggles, and finally rehabilitating him under a new ideological framework.\n\nSources Used:\n- 1_CCP_Confucianism_Legalism_chapter.md"}]}

The answer must clarify both the Sinicization process and its political purpose.  \n\nFrom *1_CCP_Confucianism_Legalism_chapter.md*:  \n- **Sinicizing Marxism** involves merging Western socialist ideology with Confucian cultural principles. Xi argues that both traditions are valid for different societies: the West pursues democracy (ancient Greek/Roman roots), while China adopts a centralized, authoritarian socialist system rooted in Confucian tradition.  \n- This allows China to maintain its one-party rule by redefining Marxism through Chinese cultural lenses, creating a \"China model\" distinct from Western liberal democracy.  \n- Key mechanisms include:  \n  - Promoting four Confucian principles (\"emphasizing politics, having faith; emphasizing regulations, having discipline...\") alongside party doctrine.  \n  - Reinterpretin Mao Zedong as a pioneer of this synthesis, retroactively legitimizing later CCP leaders like Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin.  \n\nAnswer:  \nXi Jinping resolves this tension through **Sinicization of Marxism**\u2014a process where traditional Chinese values like Confucianism are fused with Western Marxist ideology to create a unique \"China model.\" Rather than rejecting either system, he posits that:  \n1. **Western democracies** suit ancient Greek/Roman societies (thus suitable for Europe).  \n2. **Chinese socialism**, rooted in Confucian principles, aligns better with China's historical and cultural traits.  \n\nThis dual approach allows the CCP to:  \n- Justify its authoritarian rule as culturally appropriate.  \n- Present Marxism as inherent to Chinese tradition (via Mao\u2019s legacy).  \n- Reinterpret Western concepts like human rights within Confucian ethical frameworks (e.g., opposing capital punishment by invoking ancient \"eye for an eye\" traditions).  \n\nFor example, Mao Zedong is now framed as a pioneer of this synthesis, with his later successors (Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin) extending it. This \"China model\" challenges Western liberal democracy not by rejecting Marxism outright but by redefining it through Chinese cultural specificity.\n\nSources Used:\n- 1_CCP_Confucianism_Legalism_chapter.md"}]}

The CCP uses these philosophies to counter Western liberalism, assert geopolitical control, and suppress dissent by framing it as betraying traditional values.  \n\n---  \n**Answer:**  \nConfucianism and Legalism historically support authoritarianism through:  \n- **Hierarchical morality**: Confucianism stresses social order and loyalty to superiors, justifying rigid class systems.  \n- **Centralized control**: Legalism advocates strict laws enforced by a strong state\u2014a blueprint for CCP governance.  \n\nIn modern China, the resurgence reflects:  \n1. **Economic and geopolitical ambition**: China\u2019s rise challenged Western dominance, so the party weaponized ancient philosophy to assert cultural superiority.  \n2. **Domestic legitimacy**: As dissent grew, the CCP reinvented Confucius as a \"moral pioneer,\" framing its rule as true to Chinese tradition.  \n3. **Ideological warfare**: By rejecting Western-style liberalism and clinging to \"Chinese characteristics,\" China seeks to redefine global norms on its own terms.  \n\nThis revival isn\u2019t just academic; it\u2019s a toolkit for authoritarian resilience in the 21st century.\n\nSources Used:\n- 1_CCP_Confucianism_Legalism_chapter.md"}]}

The passage discusses how early CCP founders like Chen Duxiu and Yi Baisha viewed Confucianism as incompatible with modern republican values, leading to critiques. I\u2019ll focus on their objections to Confucius\u2019s philosophy and its perceived flaws.  \n\nFrom *Routledge Handbook of the Chinese Communist Party*, we know:  \n- Early CCP leaders, including Chen Duxiu, saw Confucianism as undemocratic and hierarchical.  \n- Critics like Yi Baisha argued that Confucius\u2019s teachings enabled political and intellectual dictatorship, contradictions, and prioritized the elite over the common people.  \n- The New Youth magazine published articles dismantling Confucianism, aligning with the CCP\u2019s push for a constitutional republic.  \n\nAnswer:  \nEarly Chinese Communist Party leaders like Chen Duxiu viewed Confucianism as an obstacle to modern democratic progress. They criticized its emphasis on hierarchy and obedience, arguing it reinforced authoritarianism. Key objections included:  \n1. **Political Dictatorship**: Confucian respect for authority was seen as enabling despotism.  \n2. **Ideological Control**: It allegedly stifled dissent by prioritizing the status quo.  \n3. **Elitist Bias**: Focused on cultivating loyal officials rather than uplifting the masses.  \n4. **Philosophical Inconsistency**: Confucianism\u2019s adaptability allowed it to justify widely differing regimes.  \n\nThese critiques were part of broader efforts to reject traditional ideologies in favor of Western-style democracy and science, as seen in publications like *New Youth*.

It\u2019s asking about how the Chinese government promoted Confucianism under Xi Jinping and the major initiatives that resulted. I need to recall the specific historical context, key figures, and policies mentioned in the text.  \n\nFrom *1_CCP_Confucianism_Legalism_chapter.md*, we know that Xi Jinping launched a \"Harmonious Society\" discourse alongside a \"Chinese classics fever.\" The government-backed media, like *Guangming Ribao*, increased coverage of traditional learning. A key event was Xi\u2019s 2014 speech at Confucius' anniversary celebrations, which marked the first time a Chinese president attended such an event.  \n\nThe text also mentions two major 2016 initiatives:  \n1. The National Chinese Classics Centre in Beijing Olympic Park.  \n2. A new series of textbooks promoted by the Ministry of Education, emphasizing Confucianism and traditional Chinese culture.  \n\nAdditionally, the author argues that these efforts reflect a broader attempt to reanchor China\u2019s political system on cultural roots, blending Guo Yingjie\u2019s concepts of cultural and political nationalism.  \n\nAnswer:  \nUnder Xi Jinping\u2019s administration, the Chinese government promoted Confucianism through two interconnected pillars: media/cultural initiatives and institutional reforms.  \n\n**Key Initiatives:**  \n1. **Cultural Push (\"Chinese Classics Fever\"):**  \n   - Increased coverage in state media (*Guangming Ribao*), where Confucianism became the most cited philosophy.  \n   - A 2014 spike in articles about *guoxue* (study of classics) and *rujia* (Confucianism), especially after Xi\u2019s anniversary speech at Confucius\u2019 temple.  \n\n2. **Institutional Changes:**  \n   - The 2016 National Chinese Classics Centre in Beijing, a massive cultural project under the 12th Five-Year Plan.  \n   - Textbooks introduced by the Ministry of Education (2016) to teach Confucianism nationwide, aiming to cultivate \"perfect character\" (*wanmei renge*).  \n\n**Broader Context:**  \nAuthor Guo Yingjie frames this as a shift toward *zhengjiao heyi* (integration of politics/education), blending Confucian ethics with state power. The government ties its political authority to China\u2019s cultural heritage, aligning with Guo\u2019s dual model of cultural and political nationalism.  \n\nThis approach suggests the government seeks to legitimize its rule by framing it as rooted in ancient tradition\u2014not just pragmatism or liberal democracy.\n\nSources Used:\n- 1_CCP_Confucianism_Legalism_chapter.md"}]}
