Misallocated resources have led total factor productivity growth (an economist's primary measure of economic efficiency) to drop precipitously from an average of 3.5 percent in the 2000s to only 0.7 percent in the 2010s, at the same time total debt has ballooned. 144 It is increasingly evident to those inside and outside Beijing that a decisive economic slowdown is unavoidable and happening. These unwelcomed realities have only added urgency to Xi's centralization drive as he seeks to make a virtue out of necessity: concentrating control to not only cut off local governments and vested interests from piling up debts in unproductive sectors but also steer resource allocation in centrally approved directions. As Beijing deepens a belated effort to cut off credit to old growth drivers, principally real estate construction activities, these moves have become embedded in a larger, politicized effort to shift China's growth model from \"quantity\" to \"quality,\" wherein investment is channeled in accordance with a top-down definition of \"quality\" that conspicuously serves Xi's modernization drive. Centralization and the revivification of top-down control mechanisms simultaneously aim to strengthen Xi's capacity to guide this process and to ensure the regime's preservation amid potential economic instability. | Politicized Economic Decision-Making Replaces GDP Growth Maximization |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Faced with a drastic slowdown in China's economy, the CCP has invoked Xi's modernization agenda as a rationale for deemphasizing growth rates and elevating the importance of several other aspects of economic development, prominently including environmental health, concerns over inequality, and shifting the | to Congress, November 2020; Xi Jinping, \"Uphold and Improve the Chinese Socialist System and Modernize State Governance,\" Governance of China, Volume 3, October 31, 2019, 144; Tanner Greer, \"Xi Jinping in Translation: China's Guiding Ideology,\" Palladium, May 31, 2019.\n---\n47 ## Politicized Economic Decision-Making Replaces GDP Growth Maximization\u2014Continued growth model to \"high-quality\" innovation-driven growth.* External observers initially expressed optimism that reducing a singular emphasis on growth would cut back on the negative externalities of China's model. In practice, however, deemphasizing GDP growth as the lynchpin of economic decision-making has had the opposite effect, greatly increasing the politicization of economic decision-making as the CCP takes a top-down approach to determining what constitutes high-quality growth. Numerical targets often allowed officials and enterprises leeway to experiment in how they fulfilled state-directed objectives. GDP targets, however, have been replaced by a \"confusing welter of political, social, and environmental mandates,\" according to Andrew Batson, director for China research at economic research firm Gavekal. The shift has led officials and enterprises to adhere more closely to signals from Beijing than the market.\u00b9\u2074\u2075 Rather than liberal market reform, Xi's \"grand project to reorient the Communist Party's mobilizational machinery away from the pursuit of economic growth and toward a broader set of goals, which can be summarized as the pursuit of 'national greatness' \" is instead far more \"consistent with Xi's renewed focus on ideology and political discipline.\"\u00b9\u2074\u2076 ## The Structures of Economic Decision-Making under Xi Xi is revivifying formal Leninist structures to discipline and control lower-level economic decision-making, enforce adherence to central directives, deepen the Party's penetration into all aspects of the economy, and expand and deploy macroeconomic policy planning and guidance. Structures of economic decision-making under Xi can be segmented into two areas: (1) discipline, command, and control of the Party and state bureaucracies; and (2) increased penetration and efforts to steer the nonstate sector. Xi aims to overcome the structural challenge of exerting control over a sprawling economic system, enormous geographical expanse, and massive population by conditioning the bureaucracy, local officials, state-owned enterprises, and\u2014increasingly\u2014nonstate actors to faithfully enact his nationalist modernization plans. Xi's address to the 19th Party Congress stressed the importance of developing the Party so the Party can guide the country and the economy toward modernization.\u00b9\u2074\u2077 This belief will continue to animate Xi's agenda at and beyond the 20th Party Congress. *The 19th Party Congress was the locus of a major change in this direction, as Xi altered the CCP's \"principal contradiction\" facing Chinese society away from Deng's \"ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people and backward social production\" and to his own \"unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs for a better life.\" As Neil Thomas explained in his testimony, this change in the \"principal contradiction\" is an arcane but extremely important aspect of China's governance. Neil Thomas, written testimony for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 5\u20136.\n---\n48 # Reconsolidating the Control Center: The Party-State's Economic Bureaucracy Whereas Mao Zedong was broadly \"[d]istrustful of bureaucracy\" and \"sought means of administration which minimized the role of bureaucracy,\" Xi seeks to rule through the bureaucracy, increasing its conditioning and adherence to central directives so that it may be harnessed and relied upon to faithfully steward his top-down economic program.148 ## Centralizing Economic Decision-Making Power through Institutional Restructuring The ability of central leaders to restructure both Party and state institutions is a major source of power.149 Concentration of economic decision-making within Party commissions, and the expansion in resources and institutional capacity of these bodies, provides Xi greater leverage to penetrate and guide the state bureaucracies responsible for carrying out economic policy and ensure they are responsive to his top-level design.* By moving decision-making to these commissions, Xi has shifted the locus of economic decision-making out of the Politburo Standing Committee and to himself and his coterie of loyalists that run the economic commissions. Xi has also empowered Party organs he more directly controls to reclaim command over economic policymaking and implementation processes that had devolved to the State Council, enabling his influence over economic policy to far outpace that of Li Keqiang who, as premier of the State Council, would historically have had more power over economic matters.\u2020 150 The two most important Party entities for economic policy-making in China, both upgraded from leading small groups to commissions in March 2018, are the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission.151 The former, although not principally focused on economics, is nonetheless the most important commission impacting economic policy. Nis Gr\u00fcnberg, lead analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies and an expert on China's governance, called the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission the \"powerhouse for Xi Jinping's 'top-level design' policymaking, issuing policy on a broad array of topics, including economic issues.\"152 The Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission outranks ministries and commands more political clout than China's State *Resources and personnel were syphoned away from functional ministries to staff these now expanded bodies, likely leading to \"larger permanent staff and even their own office buildings.\" Victor Shih, written testimony for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 2. \u2020Prior premiers, such as Zhu Rongji, have been given the latitude to oversee momentous economic policy programs, including banking system reorganization and state-owned enterprise reform. Beyond the structural changes, recent Party proceedings further point to the sidelining of the State Council and its leadership in matters of economic affairs. Li Keqiang was notably not referred to as \"Premier\" in the readout of the CCP's 2021 Central Economic Work Conference, whereas he was in the 2020 readout.

The Party's Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission, however, now coordinates the drafting of the actual five-year plan and makes relevant decisions on its content.[^159] Centralized economic decision-making power in Party bodies that are more pliant to Xi's commands and increasingly resourced and empowered to steer China's economic bureaucracy demonstrate Xi's desire to ensure greater compliance with his top-level directives.\n---\n\n **Finished.**"}]}

While this exceeded the World Bank's extreme poverty threshold of $1.90 in 2011 dollars, economists have argued that the standard is nevertheless too low for a country with China's aggregate wealth. For more on limits of the metrics, methodology, and accuracy of the CCP's assertion of victory over absolute poverty, see Chapter 1, Section 1, \"The Chinese Communist Party's Ambitions and Challenges at Its Centennial\" in U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2021 Annual Report to Congress, November 2021, 39; Maria Ana Lugo, Martin Raiser, and Ruslan Yemtsov, \"What's Next for Poverty Reduction Policies in China?\" Brookings Institution, September 24, 2021.\n---\n53 since 2018.179 Between June and August 2022, the president and head of the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, China's largest semiconductor government guidance fund, and four other top executives were put under investigation.180 These investigations send a strong signal and warning to the rest of the bureaucracy and those charged with implementing Xi's technological upgrading ambitions that he is not pleased with the progress. ## CCP Investigates Major Financial Institutions to Ensure Political Fealty CCP leaders are increasing scrutiny of state financial regulators and major financial institutions to ensure adherence to the Party's top-level economic policy decisions. In October 2021, the CCP Central Committee announced it would undertake a series of disciplinary inspections into China's financial regulators, state-owned banks, and major financial institutions, with a statement from the CCDI describing the inspections as part of an effort to \"strengthen the Party's leadership of financial work.\"181 The probe began as questions about China's high debt levels and inability to shift toward its \"high-quality\" growth model came into sharper relief for China's leaders: the 2021 CCDI investigation was notable for its inclusion of China's state-owned asset management companies, such as China Huarong.182 The firm's chairman, Lai Xiaomin, was executed following his conviction on bribery charges in January 2021.183 Lai's execution was followed by Huarong missing a deadline to release its 2020 Annual Report in April 2021, further rattling China's financial markets.*184 Asset management companies were not scrutinized in a prior round of CCDI inspections into China's financial sector in 2015.\u2020185 Hugely indebted property developer Evergrande's missed bond payments in September and October 2021 likely also animated Party concerns about ties between nonstate companies and state-owned lenders.\u2021186 *A host of other factors likely contributed to the Party's concerns about Huarong and its ability to dispose of nonperforming loans (NPLs). Huarong is one of the original four asset management companies established by the Chinese government in 1999 to take NPLs off the balance sheets of the country's state-owned banks amid the government's broader bailout of them at the time. Beginning in 2006, Huarong expanded into several other lines of noncore business, including banking, brokerage, and fund management services, as well as lending to property developers, thereby departing from its original mandate of helping state-owned banks dispose of NPLs and growing in systemic importance. Ling Huawei, \"Ling Huawei: Huarong Can't Be Treated Like a Normal Company in Bankruptcy Restructuring,\" Caixin, April 12, 2021. \u2020The CCDI previously investigated China's financial sector in 2015 in the wake of a stock market rout and as part of the CCP's broader anticorruption campaign. In that investigation, the CCDI dispatched 15 inspection teams across 21 financial institutions (compared to 15 inspection teams across 25 financial institutions in 2021). Analysts assess the 2015 investigation was politically motivated, targeting patronage networks linked to specific political figures as Xi moved to consolidate power. It also targeted specific forms of market malfeasance, with probes into CITIC Securities General Manager Cheng Boming for insider trading and top officials at the then China Banking Regulatory Commission for corruption.

Xi has warned China's leading officials that \"formalism and bureaucratism kill people!\"192 He has further denounced these two issues as existential threats to the Party, describing them as the most hated aspects and a core reason for the fall of the Soviet Union.193 In contrast to Western critiques of \"bureaucracy\" that focused on structural issues, the CCP has routinely treated \"bureaucratism\" as stemming from wrong thought, moral failings, and weak ideological commitment.194 As made clear in an edited volume of Xi's speeches against formalism and bureaucratism that cadres were made to study in 2020, formalism and bureaucratism result from an improper worldview and ideology as well as lack of \"faith\" and weak \"ideals and convictions.\"195 Unlike Mao, who during the Cultural Revolution incited ideological fervor among the masses to attack Party and government structures and officials, Xi is seeking to use ideology to energize Party and government officials to faithfully and vigorously carry out his top-level guidance and engage in a permanent \"self-revolution\" to internalize his sanctioned approach to thinking, behaving, and ultimately making decisions.*196 Ideologically molding official decision-making is a crucial cornerstone of Xi's approach to furthering his economic agenda, going well beyond simple reward and punishment and venturing into deeper 20, 2021, 8\u201312.\n*\"Self-revolution\" is a common theme in Xi's speeches. In context, it refers to a process of self-evaluation and self-criticism, geared especially toward inducing the individual to be a better cadre who pursues a disciplined life and thoroughly imbibes the thought and policy preferences of Xi.\n---\n55 aspects of thought control.* The inculcation of what is termed Xi Jinping's Economic Thought has only grown more intensive in the runup to the 20th Party Congress. In June 2022, the Central Propaganda Department\u2020 and the National Development and Reform Commission jointly organized and published a new book, the Outline for Studying Xi Jinping's Economic Thought, which was immediately made mandatory reading for all Party organizations at all levels.197 In studying, cadres were told to \"arm their minds with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\" so as to \"guide practice, promote work, and more consciously use Xi Jinping's economic thought to guide and solve practical problems,\" particularly in areas related to Xi's \"new development philosophy.\"\u2021 198 In effect, Xi wants CCP cadres, particularly those in the most important economic decision-making positions, to internalize his top-level economic development priorities and reflexively produce economic decisions that align with those priorities.\u00a7 Correct thought, in Xi's view, translates into correct action, allowing \"the majority of Party members and the masses to feel the formidable power of ideals and beliefs by means of practical actions.\"\u00b6 199 David Ownby and Timothy Cheek, China scholars with expertise in political ideology and governance, call Xi's efforts a \"revival of governing by ideology\" and consider them a direct response \"to the increasing social and intellectual pluralism that China's economic development and engagement with the world have produced.\"200 Governing by Ideology: Zero-COVID Campaign Puts\nPolitical Ideology over Economic Growth China's strict adherence to the Zero-COVID policy in 2022 demonstrates the extent to which top-down centralized management has displaced local discretion under Xi.

In January 2016, the PLA Discipline Inspection Com-\nmission, which had been housed in the General Political Department\nsince 1990, was returned to the CMC, giving the inspection organi-\nzation greater independence from the PLA bureaucracy.370 After this\nadjustment, CMC Vice Chairman Xu Qiliang reportedly encouraged\ndiscipline inspectors to \"take advantage of their new standing\" within\nthe PLA when investigating PLA officers' political loyalty, power, and\nresponsibility.371 In October 2017, the head of the newly relocated PLA\nDiscipline Inspection Commission was elevated to the rank of a CMC\nmember, further increasing the investigation organization's authority\nand acknowledging its heightened political significance.372 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making Xi has led a dramatic reorganization of the upper echelons of\nPLA decision-making, but below the CMC, the basic mechanisms\nfor Party control of the military\u2014political officers, and Party\ncommittees\u2014have not changed significantly. Instead of reforming\nlower Party structures, Xi is reinvigorating political work within *Mr. Lee assesses that Xi likely delegates some responsibility for such promotional decisions to\nthe director of the CMC Political Work Department, Miao Hua. Roderick Lee, written testimony\nfor U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and\nthe 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 9.\n---\n76 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making\u2014Continued these structures and pressing political officers to focus on learning military affairs to participate more in military decision-making and make political work more relevant to success in war. ### Dual Command and the Political Officer:\nThroughout the PLA, from company to theater command, the PLA continues its longstanding practice known as the \"military and political dual-leadership system.\" 374 Under this system, every unit has two principal officers, a commander and a political officer, who serve as co-equals and share joint responsibility for issuing orders and overseeing daily tasks.375 The roles are designed to be complementary, with the commander responsible for military decisions and the political officer responsible for political and personnel decisions.376 The political officer's functions combine activities similar to a chaplain, sergeant major, inspector general, judge advocate, human resources officer, social worker, and Party whip. His areas of responsibility range from ideological discipline to political and moral education, military law, soldier wellbeing, and professional development.377 ### Party Committees:\nLike the rest of society under CCP rule, the PLA also has Party organizations embedded in each military unit and major staff organization.* 378 \"This Party committee structure creates a 'trusted agent' in the aggregate,\" explains Mr. Lee. 379 \"Instead of having a single individual whom Xi trusts, a collective group of individuals who are promoted based on both political and military affairs traits are responsible for unit control and oversight.\" 380 The political officer and unit commander usually serve as the secretary and deputy secretary of their unit's Party committee.381 ### Steady State vs. Wartime Decision-Making:\nIn steady state, commanders direct day-to-day military activities while political officers ensure these operations are conducted in line with political goals.382 In transition to crisis or wartime, Mr. Lee explains, \"most of a Party committee's functions are relatively 'high-level' in nature and do not involve the Party committee needing to approve every action made within a unit.\" 383 They do, however, have the authority to review in committee any decision an individual leader, such as the commander or political officer, makes on the spot.384 ### A House Divided?\nA common PLA slogan, \"division of labor [does] not divide the house,\" reminds commanders and political officers they have different duties but must work together.385 In 2019, the PLA Daily reminded soldiers of the Gutian All-Military Political Work Conference that CMC Chairman Xi personal- *The term \"Party committee\" (\u515a\u59d4) is used for organizations that are established at the regiment level and above.

At the company level, they are referred to as \"Party branches\" (\u515a\u652f\u90e8).

In late 2021, the Ministry of National Defense again raised Xi's exhortations at the Gutian conference, recommending \"Meritorious Li Yannian,\" a new television series about a Korean War political commissar who was an expert in both military and political affairs.387 Despite these continuing efforts, tensions remain that raise questions about the degree to which this political oversight will complicate or slow the PLA's military decision-making. As Mr. Lee cited in testimony to the Commission, a \"PLA Navy officer who attended the Rim of the Pacific exercise in 2016\" expressed clear frustration with political oversight on military affairs when he \"lamented that the PLA's 'nanny command style' was inadequate for modern operations.\"388 ## Control over China's Internal Security and the Political-Legal Apparatus Similar to his efforts to assert dominance over the PLA, Xi has made it a priority since the earliest days of his leadership to control China's domestic public security apparatus.389 In addition to the reforms to China's paramilitary forces detailed above, Xi has dedicated significant attention to reforming elements and overall control of China's political-legal system.390 The political-legal system is the bureaucracy responsible for law enforcement, public security, and domestic coercion in China, including the courts, procuratorates, MPS, Ministry of State Security,* Ministry of Justice, and police academies.\u2020391 Changes to the political-legal system under Xi have sought to ensure the strict, hierarchical Party control and political loyalty of the apparatus most directly linked to domestic regime security.392 ### Motivation for Enhanced Control over Political-Legal Work Xi perceives the domestic security apparatus as a foundational guarantor of the Party's control that must remain loyal in all circumstances.393 His focus on this area most likely reflects an under- *The MPS is responsible for domestic law enforcement in China, including riot control and the overall maintenance of \"social order.\" The Ministry of State Security is China's main civilian intelligence and counterintelligence agency whose missions include protecting China's national security writ large, securing political and social stability, conducting counterintelligence, and implementing security-related laws.

While Xi is not the first CCP leader to emphasize learning lessons from the fall of the Soviet Union, his conclusions about which lessons to draw differ in some areas from those of his predecessors.42 A series of high-profile CCP propaganda documentaries on the topic produced in 2006, 2013, and 2022 illustrate this difference. Although all three documentaries emphasize the dangers of corruption, media liberalization, and hostile influences from outside powers, the 2006 documentary also includes a critique against overconcentration of power that is noticeably absent from the two films produced under Xi.\u2020 43 It criticizes the CPSU for repeatedly allowing the top leader too much discretion to make decisions without consulting others.\u2021 44 The 2013 and 2022 documentaries produced under Xi do not share this assessment and instead place a pronounced emphasis on maintaining the authority of the Party's top leader.45 According to Xi's remarks and propaganda aimed at the Party bureaucracy under his leadership, the most important factors behind the Soviet collapse include ideological competition and ---- Deeply Understand the Decisive Significance of the Two Establishes from Four Major Dimensions (\u3010\u957f\u5b89\u5bfc\u8bba\u3011\u949f\u653f\u58f0\uff1a\u4ece\u56db\u5927\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6df1\u523b\u9886\u609f\"\u4e24\u4e2a\u786e\u7acb\"\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u610f\u4e49), March 14, 2022.

One of many themes common in works at the time was that Stalin introduced an over-concentration of power and a \"dictatorship of the supreme leader\" which led to a range of secondary problems throughout Soviet government and society.

Why did the CPSU fall from power? An important reason is that competition in the ideological field was extremely intense; there was a complete negation of the Soviet Union's history [and] CPSU history, negating of Lenin, negating of Stalin, engaging in historical nihilism; ideology [was] confused, each level of Party organization had become almost useless, [and] the military was no longer under the leadership of the Party. . . .This is a lesson from the past!47 The changes Xi has wrought on China's governance system align closely with this diagnosis of the CPSU's failures, suggesting his agenda is informed in part by a desire to arrest these trends in China's own governance.48 ## Features of CCP Decision-Making in the Xi Era The CCP's decision-making under General Secretary Xi has broken away from the models of collective and consensus-based decision-making developed over time during Deng, Jiang, and Hu's periods of rule. Xi has reversed these emerging governance norms, overseeing an absorption of government functions once under the State Council into the CCP and elevating his personal leadership in a manner not seen since Mao Zedong. He also emphasizes a broad conception of national security in all policy areas so that the Party can address anything the leadership judges to be a threat. Xi's sweeping anticorruption campaign complements these efforts by removing potential rivals, shoring up Party discipline, and incentivizing loyalty to his leadership. ### Expanded CCP Decision-Making Power Xi is restructuring China's policymaking apparatus to grant greater decision-making authority to central Party bodies across policy areas, including in some areas previously delegated to the State Council and other government bodies.49 Xi's elevation of \"top-level design\"* is emblematic of his push to increase the Party's control over policy formulation and implementation in China's broader national development.50 Top-level design is intended to ensure more *The phrase \"top-level design\" predates General Secretary Xi's rule over the CCP. According to Alex He, senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, the phrase was first introduced in recommendations prepared by the CCP Central Committee for the 12th Five-Year Plan in October 2010: \"It is necessary to comprehensively move reform forward in every sector, with greater determination and courage; pay even more attention to a top-level design and an overall plan for reform; and clarify the priorities and sequences for reform.\" Alex He, \"Top-Level Design for Supremacy: Economic Policy Making in China under President Xi,\" Centre for International Governance Innovation, May 2020, 3.\n---\n34 unified implementation of central policies throughout the system.51\nBy recentralizing policy formulation to Party-led organizations,\ntop-level design seeks to overpower vested interests and bureau-\ncratic resistance to Xi's agenda.52 For Xi, this recentralization is\nimportant because it enables him to overcome diverging interests of\nState Council Ministries* and local governments that may hinder\ntheir implementation of policy directives from the Party center.53 To bring this top-level design to fruition, Xi has increased the\nnumber and bureaucratic power of Party leadership groups on core\npolicy topics. Between 2013 and 2018, Xi elevated the bureaucratic\nstatus of existing Party leading small groups\u2020 on national securi-\nty, finance and economics, and foreign affairs by converting them\ninto permanent commissions.54 Compared to leading small groups,\ncommissions are higher-ranking, more formalized bodies with more\nbureaucratic power to coordinate policy development.55 Xi also es-\ntablished new Party groups on topics such as \"comprehensively\ndeepening reform,\" \"law-based governance,\" cybersecurity, audits,\nand military-civil fusion, all of which were either founded as com-\nmissions or later elevated to that level.56 While some of these com-\nmissions' offices are located within the offices of the CCP Central\nCommittee, others have been physically placed within corresponding\nState Council ministries.57 For example, in March 2018 the CCP\nestablished a new Central Commission on Comprehensively Govern-\ning the Country According to Law with its own permanent offices at\nthe Ministry of Justice.58 March 2018 marked a key milestone in Xi's efforts to centralize\nParty control. Following its Third Plenum in February 2018, the 19th\nCentral Committee under Xi's leadership released a plan in March\ndirecting a broad reorganization of many elements of the Party-state\nbureaucracy.59 This included the establishment and upgrading of six\nof the aforementioned Party commissions as well as several other\nmeasures that explicitly moved key functions from State Council\nbodies under new Party leadership (see Table 1).60 The reorganiza-\ntion plan published jointly by the CCP Central Committee and the\nState Council emphasized the importance of furthering integration\nbetween Party and state offices.61 It also explained that the changes\naimed to improve the CCP's ability to \"design policy.\"62 ---- *The State Council is the cabinet of China's government and is the highest organ of day-to-day\ngovernance and administration. It is officially responsible for implementing policies formulated\nby the CCP. It is led by the premier and composed of 26 constituent departments and an array\nof other public institutions. Susan V.

As in other policy areas, his speeches\nand instructions are consistently used as benchmarks for the correct\npolicy direction by leaders and organs under him.420 Remarks by\nthe heads of the CPLAC in 2015 and 2019 credit Xi's instructions\nwith \"point[ing] out the correct direction\" and \"provid[ing] a grand\nblueprint\" for political-legal affairs work as well as the guidelines\nmembers of the bureaucracy need in order to \"do their jobs well.\"421\nThe 2019 regulations on political-legal work make implementing Xi\nJinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a\nNew Era the first responsibility of political-legal commissions and\ncommittees at all levels.422 In 2021, when CPLAC Secretary Gener-\nal Chen Yixin gave a speech outlining ten \"key points\" that should\nserve as a focus for the year ahead, the first goal he highlighted\nwas the promotion of large-scale learning and training activities to\n\"set off an upsurge in the study and implementation of Xi Jinping\nThought on the Rule of Law.\"423 Consequences for Security Decision-Making under Xi Perhaps more than in any other field, the lack of constraints and\nbalances on Xi's authority in the security space grants him immense\ndiscretion over the use of China's armed forces. Xi's position at the\nintersection of military and Party leadership, his restructuring of\nthe PLA and paramilitary forces, and his control over personnel de-\ncisions grant him a highly streamlined and personalized command.\nConsequently, the use and orientation of China's military and para-\nmilitary forces are subject to Xi's personal discretion. There are also\nfeatures of China's military decision-making system that tend to-\nward micromanagement and potential inefficiency. Unpredictability in Crisis Management and Escalation\nControl This combination of unparalleled authority and wide discretion\nmakes it difficult to reliably predict or influence the decisions Xi\nwill make, particularly in a crisis situation in which he may have\nless time or desire to confer with other leaders. As an example, Xi's\ncentralization of control and personalization of command in the nu-\n---\n82 clear realm means that should China decide on a launch-on-warning posture,* he alone could have somewhere in the range of ten minutes to make a personal decision about the use of nuclear weapons, a scenario Mr. Lee described in his testimony to the Commission as \"incredibly concerning.\" 424 Xi's overwhelming authority further complicates crisis situations by decreasing the likelihood that lower-level officials or interlocutors have the authority to adapt to changing situations. In his testimony before the Commission, Dr. Mulvenon expressed concern about the personalization of command under Xi, saying, \"If in fact major military decisions require Xi Jinping's personal approval... rather than an institutional mechanism, that makes crisis management, escalation control, and strategic communications potentially difficult... during the fog of war. It makes it more difficult... to establish credible defense telephone links with what we think are the operational elements of the PLA.\" 425 Xi's emphasis on the Chairman Responsibility System likely also gives him great discretion over which or how many subordinates he chooses to consult on major decisions, making it difficult to identify a reliable channel for crisis messaging. In a time-sensitive situation, there is no guarantee Xi will convene the entire CMC, and higher-ranking CMC members such as the CMC vice chairmen may be more likely than the Minister of Defense and other CMC members\u2020 to still be consulted. In this context, the question of information inputs to Xi's decision-making is paramount. Mr. Lee pointed out that the PLA's relatively well-developed and technologically supported information flows likely present Xi with access to multiple, diverse sources of information on the same situation at once, including potentially a direct video feed from relevant tactical formations, which he can use to supplement the reports of any subordinates he chooses to consult.426 From this potential abundance of information, Xi has the broad authority to draw his own conclusions and formulate his own decisions absent any predictable filter or intervention from other stakeholders.427 ---- *A launch-on-warning posture is one in which a state's military would launch nuclear weapons in retaliation for an incoming strike that has been detected but not yet detonated on its territory. Although China does not currently have a launch-on-warning posture, many recent advances in the PLA's nuclear capabilities could enable a shift to a launch-on-warning posture if desired. (For more on China's nuclear doctrine, posture, and capabilities, see U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Chapter 3, Section 2, \"China's Nuclear Forces: Moving beyond a Minimal Deterrent,\" in 2021 Annual Report to Congress, November 2021, 340\u2013385; U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2021 Annual Report to Congress, November 2021, 358, 360. \u2020Specifically, personalization of command under Xi may restrict the ability of the minister of defense, the currently designated counterpart to the U.S. secretary of defense, to act as a reliable channel to Xi in a crisis scenario. In his testimony, Dr. Wuthnow assessed that Xi's final decision-making authority means that all CMC members will transmit messages to him at the top of the system, regardless of the messenger's relative rank on the CMC. This means that in normal noncrisis scenarios, the minister of defense is likely a viable channel for messaging to Xi by virtue of his CMC status and his presence at CMC meetings, as is every CMC member. However, Xi's emphasis on the Chairman Responsibility System likely means he does not necessarily need to convene the entire CMC. If in a crisis scenario, Xi does not have time or chooses not to convene the entire CMC, the Minister of Defense (currently the third-ranking uniformed member of the CMC, Wei Fenghe) by virtue of his greater distance from Xi, would be a less reliable channel than the CMC vice chairmen. Unlike Minister Wei, both CMC vice chairmen also sit on the Politburo, making them the senior defense and military advisors to the senior-most political leadership of the CCP.

Translation.\n---\n83 ## Micromanagement of Forces by Senior Leadership Within China's military there have been longstanding concerns over micromanagement from senior leadership, a trend exacerbated by the centralization of decision-making under Xi and advances in command and control technology. As Mr. Lee explains, although the PLA appears to acknowledge warfighters' need for some level of decision-making autonomy on a theoretical level, the system nonetheless gravitates toward a highly centralized command and control structure.428 The CMC and theater commands both retain the formal authority to engage in \"skip echelon\"* command of even tactical formations and appear to actually use this capability as a matter of course.429 All theater command joint operations command centers appear to have live video feeds from virtually every weapons platform operating within their areas of responsibility.430 The upper-level leadership's tendency to push down senior officers to the tactical level appears to have become problematic enough to interfere with operations.431 To mitigate this interference, the PLA Navy issued new guidance stipulating that single-ship formations could not have a senior officer embarked onboard, which appears to be directed at affording the ship's own commander and political officer a chance to perform their job without excessive oversight.432 According to Dr. Mulvenon's assessment before the Commission, this pervasive culture of micromanagement creates risk aversion at the lower levels of the PLA and results in \"paralysis\" whenever they are cut off from upper-level command.433 ## Militarization of Internal Security Actions Stronger central control over China's paramilitary forces could potentially also contribute to greater internal instability. The thorough militarization and establishment of central control over the PAP may raise the likelihood that the central government will conceive of domestic societal concerns in military terms and enforce its domestic agenda with military force.434 Local governments' loss of ability to independently deploy the PAP may also result in delays and slower response times to local emergencies.435 Dr. Wuthnow assessed that local governments may hesitate to request approval from the center to deploy the PAP in emergencies for fear of appearing to have lost control of the situation.436 ### Decision-Making Surrounding a Taiwan Invasion A decision to take military action over Taiwan is ultimately a political one.437 Xi's preeminent role in China's military decision-making contributes to dangerous uncertainty\u2020 in the Taiwan Strait by making it difficult to predict the timing of a potential decision to invade Taiwan. As the Commission noted in its 2021 Annual Report, factors such as a misreading of U.S. ---- *\"Skip-echelon\" command refers to a practice in which high-level command authorities bypass intermediate command levels to directly command lower-level units. \u2020For more on decision-making surrounding a Taiwan invasion and recent changes to the military balance generating uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait, see U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Chapter 4, \"A Dangerous Period for Cross-Strait Deterrence: Chinese Military Capabilities and Decision-Making for a War over Taiwan,\" in 2021 Annual Report to Congress, November 2021, 387\u2013438.\n---\n84 ## Decision-Making Surrounding a Taiwan Invasion\u2014Continued policy, a belief that a U.S. threat to intervene is not credible, or a focus on Xi's personal ambitions could all contribute to a deterrence failure whereby the CCP leadership orders the PLA to attack Taiwan. 438 The structural changes Xi has undertaken to make military decision-making responsive to his direction mean that his personal beliefs and assessments on these matters could have an outsized or potentially even deciding role in a decision to invade. Xi possesses broad authority over the military situation by nature of his position as chairman of a restructured CMC, and he is the only individual on the Politburo Standing Committee with a military portfolio. 439 Compounding this risk, it is uncertain whether the PLA will truthfully report to Xi about their capabilities and readiness to invade Taiwan, since it may be politically dangerous to admit to the top leader that the capabilities are not ready after being the focus of PLA modernization efforts for so long. 440 ## Implications for the United States In the 20 years prior to General Secretary Xi, networks of top leaders and their proteges deliberated policy choices, and an array of interest groups contributed to decision-making on key policies. Xi has claimed a decisive role for himself in formulating economic, foreign, and security policy. This reversal from the increasing institutionalization, state bureaucratic control, and consensus leadership of his predecessors back to central leadership by Party organization\u2014with Xi at the center of most decision-making bodies\u2014has several implications for how the United States should manage its competition with China. The elevation of Xi's personalistic rule means U.S. policymakers can confidently interpret any decision articulated by Xi as sure to galvanize change in China's policy direction. Because of Xi's overwhelming authority, the substance of policies directly affiliated with him by name or through his public involvement is relatively unlikely to be subject to major reinterpretation, even if public messaging around them changes slightly. This may afford a degree of predictability in China's policy stance, but it also underscores that Xi has a uniquely powerful role in economic, foreign, and security decision-making. Absent avenues for communication with Xi and his immediate advisers, the United States may face increased risk. Because of China's structure as a unified Party-state and the dramatic recentralization of Party control that has occurred over the last decade, effective diplomatic engagements and communication with China depend upon developing contact with the people within China's system who hold key Party positions and through those have the authority to make recommendations and influence policy. This requires looking beyond the government organs that most closely match the United States' own system and focusing on the positions of influence one holds in the Party structure. The central management of policymaking by the Party apparatus under Xi means that\n---\n85\n---\n\nChunk 2\nSource: CCP_Decision_Making_Xi_Chapter1_Feb2025.md\n---\n436.

Despite stated commitments to equal opportunity and fair representation by the CCP and the Chinese government,\u2021 women have limited representation and voice across the top echelons of China's political system.15 Historically, female representatives have rarely constituted more than 10 percent of the roughly 300-member CCP Central Committee.16 Only 6 women have ever served in the 25-member Politburo, half of whom were the wives of other top leaders.17 No woman has ever served on the Politburo Standing Committee or held any of the top three positions in China's political system: CCP general secretary, chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), and state chairman.\u00a718 Female representation in key government roles such as ministries and provincial governorships is also extremely low.19 The percentage of People's Liberation Army (PLA) servicemembers who are female is not publicly available, but a Chinese military newspaper estimated in 2015 that approximately 5 percent or fewer were women.20 Currently, no women hold senior command or political commissar positions in the PLA.21 | Informal rules and procedures have emerged alongside a shift to\ncollective decision-making. These norms include mandatory retire-\nment age and term limits for CCP Politburo members, cadre eval-\nuation systems, and regional representation in the CCP Central\nCommittee. Some analysts argue these norms have contributed to *Difficulties in consensus building extend throughout the broader Party-state bureaucracy. A\nprovincial Party secretary, for example, has the same bureaucratic rank in China's political sys-\ntem as the minister of a State Council-level ministry. The interests and policy preferences of one\nminister may correspond with or diverge from those of a broader array of other ministries and\nlocal governments, with central Party leaders serving as the ultimate arbiters of decision-mak-\ning. As a result, decisions from the top are often interpreted in different ways by localities and\nministries, creating a \"fragmented authoritarianism\" style of governance in China's political\nsystem.

At the 15th Party Congress in 1997, then General Secretary Jiang Zemin imposed a mandatory retirement age on the CCP leadership, and all leaders aged 70 or older resigned.26 This rule, issued in spite of the fact that then General Secretary Jiang himself was 71, forced Qiao Shi, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and disliked by Jiang, to retire.27 Then General Secretary Jiang lowered the retirement age to 67 at the 16th Party Congress in 2002 to remove another political rival, Li Ruihuan.28 While these norms have always been informal and abused at the margins by his immediate predecessors, General Secretary Xi has fully taken advantage of their informality to strengthen his control. He has proven more effective than Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao in preventing opposing factions from challenging his leadership, upsetting any prior trend toward factional balancing. Whereas the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee of the 17th Party Congress (2007\u20132012) featured four members of the Communist Youth League faction, the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee of the 19th Party Congress (2017\u20132022) featured only one (Premier Li Keqiang).29 ## Xi's Justification for Reasserting Party Control Xi's drive to reassert the CCP's role in decision-making springs from what he perceived to be critical weaknesses in China's governance capacity under his recent predecessors.30 A document known as a \"historical resolution\"\u2021 that Xi directed in order to reinforce his ---- *Dr. Li categorizes these factions as an \"elitist coalition\" of leaders from the families of CCP revolutionaries (e.g., Jiang Zemin, Xi Jinping) and a \"populist\" faction of leaders who advanced their careers by way of the Communist Youth League and have oriented policy toward economic equality and regional development (Hu Jintao, Li Keqiang). The factional groups Dr. Li identifies are not exhaustive, with several other loose groupings of political networks also observable in China's elite politics. Cheng Li, Chinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era: Reassessing Collective Leadership, Brookings Institution Press, 2019, 251\u2013256; Cheng Li, \"A Biographical and Factional Analysis of the Post-2012 Politburo,\" China Leadership Monitor, June 6, 2013. \u2020For example, analysts at MacroPolo observe that retirement rules, retained since 1997 and consistently enforced since 2002, have worked to usher in new political leadership every 5\u201310 years. Damien Ma and Joshua Henderson, \"Age Rules: The Arrival of the Post-60s Generation in Chinese Politics,\" MacroPolo, December 31, 2021. \u2021A \"historical resolution\" is a high-level Party document that presents an official summary of CCP history. CCP leaders including Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Xi Jinping have used the production of a historical resolution to address important political issues of their time with bear-\n---\n31 own leadership ahead of the 20th Party Congress claims that \"pre-\nviously lax and weak governance\" under his reform-era predeces-\nsors had damaged the CCP's reputation, cohesiveness, and national\ngovernance abilities.31 First, the document assesses that a \"lack of\nawareness\" by the previous Party leadership had permitted \"weak,\nineffective, diluted, and marginalized efforts in implementation\" of\nthe Party's major policies and \"feigned compliance\" from lower-level\nofficials, jeopardizing the CCP's ability to enact its desired policies.32\nSecond, it argues that previous failures to stringently govern Par-\nty organizations had fostered \"a serious lack of political conviction\"\namong Party members and officials as well as \"a startling level of\ncorruption\" that damaged the Party's public image and therefore\nthreatened its authority.33 In the economic sphere, the historical\nresolution argues that an \"undue emphasis on the rate and scale of\ngrowth\" since the beginning of \"reform and opening up\" had created\n\"institutional and structural problems in China's economy\" that only\na strong Party could address.*34 In military affairs, it assesses that\nweak Party control over the armed forces under recent leadership\nhad endangered both the Party's political security and China's mili-\ntary effectiveness.35 Finally, it argues that China needs to bolster its\nabilities to defend its national security and navigate an increasingly\ncomplex international environment.36 The solution to all of these de-\nficiencies, in Xi's analysis, was strengthening Party leadership over\nthe organs of governance.37 Xi also justifies his own personal elevation as a means to strength-\nen the overall authority of China's political leadership. Xuezhi Guo,\nprofessor and chair of the political science department at Guilford\nCollege, argues in his book The Politics of the Core Leader in Chi-\nna that having a clear paramount leader facilitates penetration of\nParty authority into society because the aura of unified leadership\nfosters greater willingness to acquiesce to Party directives.38 It also\nallows the leader to imprint the force of his personality on import-\nant policies.39 Party sources advance this argument by framing the\nexpansion of Xi's authority as beneficial for both Party unity and\nChina's overall future.\u2020 Chinese politics expert Alice Miller assesses ing on their personal leadership and legacy.

In January 2016, the PLA Discipline Inspection Com-\nmission, which had been housed in the General Political Department\nsince 1990, was returned to the CMC, giving the inspection organi-\nzation greater independence from the PLA bureaucracy.370 After this\nadjustment, CMC Vice Chairman Xu Qiliang reportedly encouraged\ndiscipline inspectors to \"take advantage of their new standing\" within\nthe PLA when investigating PLA officers' political loyalty, power, and\nresponsibility.371 In October 2017, the head of the newly relocated PLA\nDiscipline Inspection Commission was elevated to the rank of a CMC\nmember, further increasing the investigation organization's authority\nand acknowledging its heightened political significance.372 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making Xi has led a dramatic reorganization of the upper echelons of\nPLA decision-making, but below the CMC, the basic mechanisms\nfor Party control of the military\u2014political officers, and Party\ncommittees\u2014have not changed significantly. Instead of reforming\nlower Party structures, Xi is reinvigorating political work within *Mr. Lee assesses that Xi likely delegates some responsibility for such promotional decisions to\nthe director of the CMC Political Work Department, Miao Hua. Roderick Lee, written testimony\nfor U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and\nthe 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 9.\n---\n76 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making\u2014Continued these structures and pressing political officers to focus on learning military affairs to participate more in military decision-making and make political work more relevant to success in war. ### Dual Command and the Political Officer:\nThroughout the PLA, from company to theater command, the PLA continues its longstanding practice known as the \"military and political dual-leadership system.\" 374 Under this system, every unit has two principal officers, a commander and a political officer, who serve as co-equals and share joint responsibility for issuing orders and overseeing daily tasks.375 The roles are designed to be complementary, with the commander responsible for military decisions and the political officer responsible for political and personnel decisions.376 The political officer's functions combine activities similar to a chaplain, sergeant major, inspector general, judge advocate, human resources officer, social worker, and Party whip. His areas of responsibility range from ideological discipline to political and moral education, military law, soldier wellbeing, and professional development.377 ### Party Committees:\nLike the rest of society under CCP rule, the PLA also has Party organizations embedded in each military unit and major staff organization.* 378 \"This Party committee structure creates a 'trusted agent' in the aggregate,\" explains Mr. Lee. 379 \"Instead of having a single individual whom Xi trusts, a collective group of individuals who are promoted based on both political and military affairs traits are responsible for unit control and oversight.\" 380 The political officer and unit commander usually serve as the secretary and deputy secretary of their unit's Party committee.381 ### Steady State vs. Wartime Decision-Making:\nIn steady state, commanders direct day-to-day military activities while political officers ensure these operations are conducted in line with political goals.382 In transition to crisis or wartime, Mr. Lee explains, \"most of a Party committee's functions are relatively 'high-level' in nature and do not involve the Party committee needing to approve every action made within a unit.\" 383 They do, however, have the authority to review in committee any decision an individual leader, such as the commander or political officer, makes on the spot.384 ### A House Divided?\nA common PLA slogan, \"division of labor [does] not divide the house,\" reminds commanders and political officers they have different duties but must work together.385 In 2019, the PLA Daily reminded soldiers of the Gutian All-Military Political Work Conference that CMC Chairman Xi personal- *The term \"Party committee\" (\u515a\u59d4) is used for organizations that are established at the regiment level and above. At the battalion level and in second-level functional and administrative departments of the PLA, the relevant Party organ is called a \"grassroots Party committee\" (\u57fa\u5c42\u515a\u59d4). At the company level, they are referred to as \"Party branches\" (\u515a\u652f\u90e8). The term \"Party small group\" (\u515a\u5c0f\u7ec4) is used at the platoon level and for ad hoc organizations at any level that are created for a specific purpose and have three or more Party members. Kenneth W. Allen et al., \"Personnel of the People's Liberation Army,\" BluePath Labs (prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission), November 2022, 17.\n---\n77 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making\u2014Continued ly hosted five years earlier where he raised concerns that some political officers had become useless because they were afraid to speak their voice or insert their hand in military affairs.386 Xi exhorted political officers to get more involved in operations, training, and military command and control so that they could learn to make political work a greater part of military success in wartime. In late 2021, the Ministry of National Defense again raised Xi's exhortations at the Gutian conference, recommending \"Meritorious Li Yannian,\" a new television series about a Korean War political commissar who was an expert in both military and political affairs.387 Despite these continuing efforts, tensions remain that raise questions about the degree to which this political oversight will complicate or slow the PLA's military decision-making. As Mr. Lee cited in testimony to the Commission, a \"PLA Navy officer who attended the Rim of the Pacific exercise in 2016\" expressed clear frustration with political oversight on military affairs when he \"lamented that the PLA's 'nanny command style' was inadequate for modern operations.\"388 ## Control over China's Internal Security and the Political-Legal Apparatus Similar to his efforts to assert dominance over the PLA, Xi has made it a priority since the earliest days of his leadership to control China's domestic public security apparatus.389 In addition to the reforms to China's paramilitary forces detailed above, Xi has dedicated significant attention to reforming elements and overall control of China's political-legal system.390 The political-legal system is the bureaucracy responsible for law enforcement, public security, and domestic coercion in China, including the courts, procuratorates, MPS, Ministry of State Security,* Ministry of Justice, and police academies.\u2020391 Changes to the political-legal system under Xi have sought to ensure the strict, hierarchical Party control and political loyalty of the apparatus most directly linked to domestic regime security.392 ### Motivation for Enhanced Control over Political-Legal Work Xi perceives the domestic security apparatus as a foundational guarantor of the Party's control that must remain loyal in all circumstances.393 His focus on this area most likely reflects an under- *The MPS is responsible for domestic law enforcement in China, including riot control and the overall maintenance of \"social order.\" The Ministry of State Security is China's main civilian intelligence and counterintelligence agency whose missions include protecting China's national security writ large, securing political and social stability, conducting counterintelligence, and implementing security-related laws. Timothy Heath, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on What Keeps Xi Up at Night: Beijing's Internal and External Challenges, February 7, 2019, 8\u20139. \u2020The Chinese Communist Party Regulations on the Political Legal Work issued in January 2019 define \"political-legal units\" as \"specialized forces engaged in political-legal work under the leadership of the Party, primarily including judicial organs, procuratorial organs, public security organs, national security organs, judicial administrative organs, and other units.\" Xinhua, \"CCP Central Committee Publishes \"Chinese Communist Party Regulations on Political-Legal Work\" (\u4e2d\u5171\u4e2d\u592e\u5370\u53d1\u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u653f\u6cd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6761\u4f8b\u300b), January 18, 2019.

Nevertheless, upon his rise to power Xi perceived that the han-\ndle of the knife had slipped dangerously out of the control of the\nCCP top leadership.398 Under Hu Jintao, the public security appa-\nratus had enjoyed a significant level of autonomy and policy influ-\nence vis-\u00e0-vis the CCP top leadership in a manner similar to the\nmilitary.399 Then Politburo Standing Committee member and head\nof the Party's Central Political-Legal Affairs Commission (CPLAC)\nZhou Yongkang, for example, possessed a firm grip over the regime's\nintelligence and security bureaucracy and became a cautionary tale\nof the dangers of such independent power.400 Zhou was suspected\nof not only corruption but also conspiring with Bo Xilai against the\ncentral Party leadership and attempting to contravene a Politbu-\nro Standing Committee consensus to purge the disgraced leader.401\nCorruption and clientelism were also areas of concern.402 According\nto analysis by Christopher Johnson, senior fellow at the Center for\nStrategic and International Studies, published in conjunction with\nthe Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin, Xi perceived that\nlax leadership by his predecessor had allowed the domestic security\napparatus so much leeway as to pose a threat to the cohesion of the\nParty system itself.\u2020 403\n---\n\n **Finished.**"}]}

The overall goal of these efforts appears to have been centralizing Party control while simultaneously preventing the reemergence of any position powerful enough to challenge the top leadership. Lines of effort have included a realignment of the Party's existing CPLAC and its associated hierarchy;* the subordination of political-legal work to Xi's newly defined national security goals and institutions; an ongoing series of campaigns to ensure loyalty from the system's leaders and personnel; and relentless promotion of Xi's leading role in political-security work. ## Reorientation and Subordination of the CPLAC In contrast to elevating the bureaucratic status of other key Party commissions, Xi lowered the bureaucratic status of the CPLAC even while expanding its areas of authority to centralize Party control. This anomaly was likely intended to prevent any leader of the domestic security apparatus from developing a unique power base. Following Zhou Yongkang's expulsion from the Party, his former portfolio as head of the CPLAC was immediately downgraded from the Politburo Standing Committee level, where it had been since the early 2000s, to the Politburo level.404 The demotion would severely limit the ability of any future commission head to contravene the decisions of the top CCP leadership the way Zhou had attempted. The CCP also began to phase out the dual-hatting of local-level political-legal committee heads as the heads of local public security bureaus.405 This reversed a practice that had become common since the late 1990s and 2000s and that had allowed the local political-legal organs to play an extremely active role in local domestic security affairs.406 With these changes in place, the CPLAC's areas of responsibility could be safely expanded as part of the broad Party-state reorganization effort. In March 2018, the CCP consolidated responsibility for additional channels of political-legal work within the CPLAC by directing it to absorb the majority of the functions of three other Party leading small groups and commissions.407 These were the Central Commission on Comprehensive Management of Societal Security, the Central Leading Small Group on Maintaining Stability Work, and the Central Leading Small Group for the Prevention and Handling of Cult Issues.\u2020408 ruption struggle on the political and legal fronts is still grim.

Minxin Pei, \"The CCP's Domestic Security Taskmaster: The Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission,\" China Leadership Monitor (September 1, 2021): 3\u201312. \u2020The CPLAC absorbed all of the functions of the first two organizations, the Central Commission on Comprehensive Management of Societal Security and the Central Leading Small Group on Maintaining Stability Work. In the case of the third organization, the Central Leading Small Group for the Prevention and Handling of Cult Issues, the CPLAC took on the disbanded group's decision-making responsibilities while the MPS absorbed some of its administrative and implementation functions. The reorganization plan assigned responsibility for information gathering, analysis, and policy implementation to the MPS as a government ministry, whereas the CPLAC as a Party organization was tasked with policy coordination and making policy recommendations\n---\n80 Like other parts of the bureaucracy under Xi, the CPLAC and its associated hierarchy also appear to have been subject to the overall authority of the CNSC and its hierarchy. Following the establishment of the CNSC under Xi's leadership, experts have predicted that the new national security commission may supplant the leadership of the existing political-legal commission over domestic security issues.409 While the full details of the relationship between the two Party groups remain unknown, there are several indicators that the political-legal affairs organizations are required to follow the leadership of the CNSC. First, as previously indicated, the head of the CPLAC is currently a Politburo-level position, whereas the head of the CNSC is Xi himself. Second, the last available list of the full membership of the CNSC, which dates from 2017, includes the head of the CPLAC (then Meng Jianzhu) as a member of the CNSC, along with the Minister of Public Security.410 Third, new regulations released in 2019 require that political-legal work \"adhere to the Comprehensive National Security Concept\" and explicitly direct lower-level political-legal committees to \"implement the decisions and arrangements\" of central and local national security commission leadership organizations at every level.411 Personnel Changes Xi has also gone to great lengths to ensure the loyalty of the political-legal apparatus by replacing most of its leadership, many by means of the anticorruption campaign, with people he trusts.412 According to Dr. Wu, since taking power in 2012 Xi has presided over at least three purges of the MPS and political-legal apparatus.413 The first wave centered around the removal of Zhou Yongkang along with many of Zhou's proteges and much of the leadership of the MPS. According to Dr. Wu, to accomplish this feat so early in his time as general secretary, Xi relied on support from not only Wang Qishan (then in charge of the CCP's Central Discipline-Inspection Committee) but also several other groups of officials both inside and outside the public security apparatus.* 414 Dr. Wu assesses that the ensuing purges in 2018 and 2020 have represented \"an ongoing process of power redistribution\" among those groups, with each wave bringing to power individuals with closer ties to Xi than those who had come before.415 The Party under Xi has demonstrated a strong focus on managing and developing the political quality of both the leaders in the system and the rank-and-file public security personnel. A readout of Xi's guiding speech in January 2015 states, \"It is necessary to strengthen and improve the leadership of political-legal work; choose to the CCP Central Committee.

Decisions to adjust course on China's policy choices most likely must be initiated or approved by either Xi or potentially the head of a relevant Party commission. Similarly, Xi's unparalleled authority and wide discretion on military affairs make it difficult to reliably predict or influence the decisions he will make or which interlocutors he will involve in decisions. This is particularly the case in a crisis situation, when he may have less time or desire to confer with other leaders before making a decision. It also means external pressure can only be effective if faithfully conveyed to key Party decision-making bodies for consideration. Typically high-sounding state positions like minister of foreign affairs and minister of defense are a full step away from the Party leaders making decisions in their areas of responsibility. The recentralization of decision-making power within the CCP under Xi's leadership accompanies tighter CCP supervision of the entire Party-state bureaucracy to ensure adherence with Xi's policy choices. As a result, the CCP can ensure rapid mobilization of resources to advance Xi's policy objectives and execution of his decisions, but it may also limit the CCP's ability to correct its policy mistakes or adjust course. This inability to adjust course regardless of economic and security implications poses a challenge to U.S. strategic planning and responses. This may be particularly relevant in late 2022, when the CCP will reshuffle its leadership. Economic headwinds buffeting the Chinese economy are occurring just as Xi prepares to extend his leadership over the CCP at the 20th Party Congress. This politically sensitive year may push Xi to dismiss the economic costs of his policy choices as he looks to protect his position. Finally, even though the state bodies have always been led by CCP officials and subject to Party guidance, China's policy increasingly grows out of Party structures and under the auspices of Party leaders who are concerned with ensuring the Party's continued supremacy. Effective assessments of China's strategic intent must take into account the worldview and organizational limitations of the CCP as well as the material objectives the Party judges might best suit \"China\" as a whole. Furthermore, because all major policy decisions made by Xi are now couched in uncompromising national security terms, the United States and other countries seeking to defend their own interests in interactions with China should anticipate and plan for vocal or even coercive retaliation against actions the CCP is likely to interpret as harmful to its interests.\n---\n86 # Appendix: The CCP's 2022 20th National Congress ## Introduction - **Party Congress Overview:** The CCP's National Congress, usually referred to simply as the \"Party Congress,\" convenes every five years to determine the leadership positions within the CCP.*441 As of this report's writing, the CCP's 20th Party Congress is scheduled to begin on October 16, 2022.442 The event will determine key players in the Party system and set the tone and agenda for China's policymaking for at least the next five years.443 - **Xi's Intentions for the 20th Party Congress:** At this year's 20th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi likely will seek to extend his leadership of the CCP, place additional individuals he trusts in positions of power, further elevate his political profile through amendments to the Party charter, further entrench his policy agenda through speeches and high-level documents, and continue the process of adjusting institutional arrangements of power within the Party.444 ## Party Congress Process - **Sequence of Events:** The roughly 2,300 delegates\u2020 participating in the Party Congress will convene in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.445 The delegates will select the new CCP Central Committee and the Central Committee for Discipline Inspection in a modestly competitive process.\u2021446 When the selection process is complete, a list of the new Central Committee Members and Alternate Members will be distributed and circulated to the media.\u00a7447 Immediately following the conclusion of the Congress, usually on the following day, the newly selected Central Committee con- *The turnover of CCP positions at the Party Congress is only one of the two major events that determine the national leadership of China's Party-state system. It is followed by the turnover of state positions in the meeting of the National People's Congress in the next spring. Thus, the process of leadership turnover begun at the 20th Party Congress in the fall of 2022 will not be completed until the conclusion of the National People's Congress in March 2023. Yew Lun Tian, \"Factbox: How China's Communist Party Congress Works,\" Reuters, October 14, 2022; Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, \"China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress,\" Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 23. \u2020According to Xinhua, delegates represent 38 provinces and other provincial-level entities (autonomous regions, centrally administered municipalities, and special administrative regions), certain central authorities, the central financial sector, and Beijing-based centrally administered state-owned enterprises. The election process for delegates includes five steps Xinhua describes as \"the nomination of candidates by Party members; a nominee review; public notification of the candidates for feedback; candidate shortlists; and the final vote in each electoral unit.\" Xinhua, \"How CPC Elects Delegates to Upcoming Party Congress,\" April 23, 2022. \u2021At the CCP's last Party Congress in October 2017, delegates selected 204 candidates out of a list of 222 for full membership on the Central Committee. Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, \"China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress,\" Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 9\u201310. \u00a7According to Susan Lawrence, specialist in Asian Affairs at the Congressional Research Service, if Xi's name is included in this list of Central Committee Members, it is an indication he will likely be selected for a third term as CCP general secretary, as the position of general secretary can only be held by a member of the Central Committee. If Xi's name does not appear on this list, it is an advance indication that he will not retain the position of general secretary. This could mean either that he is expected to step down entirely or that he will take a different approach to remaining in power that does not require him to be a member of the Central Committee. This was the approach taken by Jiang Zemin in 2002 when he relinquished the position of general secretary to Hu Jintao but retained the position of CMC chairman. Susan Lawrence, remarks at \"Toward Xi's Third Term: China's 20th Party Congress and Beyond,\" January 20, 2022, 29.\n---\n87 venes its first plenary session.448 It is at this meeting that the new Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee, general secretary, and CMC are selected.449 After the conclusion of the Central Committee's first plenary session, the newly selected Politburo Standing Committee, headed by the general secretary, have in the past been revealed in rank order at a live, televised press conference.450 - Indicators of Xi's Influence on the Process: At the 17th and 18th Party Congresses in 2007 and 2012, Hu Jintao's Administration conducted straw polls for Central Committee members to express their opinions on candidates for the Politburo.451 Although the results of these polls were secret and nonbinding, they reportedly did influence the ultimate selection of Politburo members.452 At the 19th Party Congress, by contrast, Xi replaced straw polls with face-to-face consultations.453 Given an emphasis in Party media on the delegates' need to uphold Xi's position as the core of the Central Committee and the Party, Xi may have used his influence to adjust the process in his favor in the runup to the 20th Party Congress.454 ## Outcomes to Watch in 2022 - Xi's Position and Title: The most visible and consequential outcome of the 20th Party Congress will be a determination of Xi's status as the top leader of the CCP. Xi is widely expected to break with recent precedent and remain at the head of the CCP beyond the 20th Party Congress,* potentially securing a third term as CCP general secretary. Some analysts have even suggested Xi may use the occasion of the 20th Party Congress to claim the position of \"CCP chairman,\" which was abolished shortly after the death of Mao Zedong.455 Any continuation of Xi's leadership would likely presage a continuation and intensification of his existing policy agenda. His resignation or removal would mark a significant shift in China's political landscape. - Succession: In the event Xi remains the Party's top leader, another important outcome will be whether he identifies one or more potential successors. At the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Xi broke with recent precedent by not indicating any presumptive successors.\u2020 456 Continued silence on this issue at the 20th Party Congress would intensify existing concerns about the potential for instability in the hypothetical event of Xi's untimely demise or departure from power.457 It may also provide clues into Xi's intended tenure at the top of the system or his level of confidence in his political control.\u2021 *The position of CCP general secretary does not have an explicit term limit, but Xi's two immediate predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, served only two five-year terms. By this precedent, Xi, who became general secretary in 2012, would be expected to step down at the 20th Party Congress in 2022. Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, \"China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress,\" Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 11. \u2020Xi was identified alongside Li Keqiang as one of Hu Jintao's two presumptive successors at the 17th Party Congress in 2007, which began Hu's second term as general secretary. Hu was similarly anointed as the \"heir apparent\" to his predecessor Jiang Zemin in 1992. Congressional Research Service, \"China's 17th Communist Party Congress, 2007: Leadership and Policy Implications,\" EveryCRSReport.com, December 5, 2007; Cheng Li, \"China: Riding Two Horses at Once,\" Brookings Institution, October 23, 2007. \u2021The meaning of this decision could nonetheless be interpreted multiple ways. A decision not to designate any successors could be interpreted as a signal of Xi's confidence and his intention\n---\n88 - Appointments: Appointments to the CCP's Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee will likely reveal key supporters of the CCP top leader. Assessing the level of adherence to informal retirement and promotional norms for these senior positions could also provide clues about the top leader's political capital to advance his allies. - Politburo Standing Committee: Most new appointments to the Politburo Standing Committee have historically come from the ranks of the previous Politburo.^458 From within the Politburo, male, nonmilitary members below the prevailing retirement age have accounted for most of the promotions.^* ^459 Appointments at the 20th Party Congress that do not conform to these trends would be particularly notable. In particular, younger leaders \"helicoptered\" to the Politburo Standing Committee without first serving on the Politburo are relatively likely to be targeted for serving in a top leadership position in the future. For example, Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping, and Li Keqiang were all elevated from the Central Committee to the Politburo Standing Committee in this way in 1992 and 2007.^460\n---\n\n **Finished.**"}]}

Translation.\n---\n41 ## Xi's \"Comprehensive National Security Concept\" Xi has introduced a so-called \"Comprehensive National Security Concept\"* that argues that threats to the CCP regime may originate from any field in the domestic or international arena and that these threats require coordinated, proactive efforts to manage. Its introduction in 2014 heralded a dramatic broadening and elevation of the concept of national security within China's policy framework.106 As Sheena Chestnut Greitens, associate professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, testified before the Commission, the concept is primarily concerned with threats to the security of the CCP regime and political system.107 According to official descriptions, it covers a wide and expanding range of policy areas within the definition of national security.108 To date, this includes at least political security, military security, territorial security, economic security, cultural security, societal security, scientific security, internet security, environmental security, resource security, nuclear security, security of overseas interests, space security, deep sea security, polar security, and biological security.\u2020 109 The concept considers both internal and external threats in each of these areas as well as the potential for the two types of threats to interact with and exacerbate one another.110 It further emphasizes the importance of proactive efforts to neutralize threats before they cause lasting damage.111 To better coordinate the expansion of security responsibilities throughout the bureaucracy, Xi has strengthened central control by creating the Central National Security Commission (CNSC) and its associated hierarchy.112 Xi presided over the creation of the CNSC in 2014 by elevating the previously ad hoc Central National Security Leading Small Group to the status of a permanent commission, thereby granting it a permanent staff office, a regular membership, and a position of greater influence within the bureaucracy.113 Since 2014, the CNSC has served as the CCP Central Committee's official \"coordinating mechanism for decision-making and discussion\" on the broad range of issues now deemed \"national security\" affairs and the institutional manifestation of Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept.114 It functions as the highest decision-making body for integrated national security issues, merging the bureaucratic stove- *The term is also sometimes translated \"overall national security concept\" or \"holistic national security concept.\" Manoj Kewalramani, \"Xi's Boao Forum Speech - 20th Party Congress Nominations - State Council on Agriculture & Energy Security - Xinjiang Secretary Ma Xingrui on National Security - Wang Yi's South Caucasus Diplomacy,\" Tracking People's Daily, April 21, 2022; Joel Wuthnow, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 2; Sheena Chestnut Greitens, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on U.S.-China Relations at the Chinese Communist Party's Centennial, January 28, 2021, 1. \u2020Party sources often describe the relationship between various areas as: \"the security of the people as the aim; political security as the fundamental principle; economic security as the foundation; military, cultural, and societal security as guarantees; and the promotion of international security as the source of support.\" Tang Aijun, \"Ideological Security in the Framework of the Overall National Security Outlook\" (\u603b\u4f53\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u89c2\u89c6\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5b89\u5168), Socialism Studies, December 12, 2019.

Consequences arising from this recentralization include: - Centralized decision-making encourages further reliance on\ncampaign-style governance, which is ill-suited to addressing lon-\nger-term, structural challenges: As a Leninist party, the CCP is\ninherently mobilizational and often formulates and implements\npolicy in a campaign-style manner.120 Campaigns are appealing\nbecause in demanding rapid and clear results, they can over-\ncome bureaucracy and give the impression of responsiveness to\npolicy problems.121 By increasing the system's responsiveness to\ncentralized directives, Xi's streamlining of the system increases\nthe attractiveness of the mobilizational approach to policy for-\nmulation. Mr. Thomas testified that a mobilizational approach\ncan yield results in policy areas with short-term, measurable,\nand easily defined goals, such as the improvement of air quality\nin China's industrial northeast.122 Campaign-style governance\nis less effective in resolving longer-term structural challenges\nsuch as China's economic slowdown, declining productivity, and\nhigh debt levels, which require careful balancing between dif- *The group's broad membership reflects the requirements of the comprehensive national secu-\nrity concept's expansive and integrated nature.

Because the CMC chairman is the only individual to sit on both the Politburo Standing Committee and the CMC, the position gives Xi sole responsibility for coordination between the two most powerful bodies in the Party.335 Xi has also worked to strengthen the position's authority by placing a renewed emphasis on the \"Chairman Responsibility System,\" a stipulation in the 1982 PRC Constitution that grants ultimate authority for military affairs to the CMC chairman.336 Under Xi's predecessors Jiang and Hu, the CMC's two uniformed vice chairmen took responsibility for the majority of CMC decision-making on the chairman's behalf in a pattern that became known as the \"Vice Chairman Responsibility System.\"337 Xi identified this arrangement as a major contributor to a trend of excessive PLA autonomy and has done away with it in favor of concentrating power in his own hands.338 A 2017 amendment to the PRC Constitution and a 2020 military regulation on political work cemented this status by giving Xi final say in all CMC work and the ability to set the military's agenda on all political and operational issues.*339 According to Mr. Lee's assessment in his testimony for the Commission, the anecdotal evidence available by cataloguing Xi's military meeting agenda since becoming CMC chairman in 2012 suggests he is particularly involved in decision-making on defining PLA reform milestones and objectives, transforming the Southern Theater Command into a modern joint operations command organization, and modernizing the PLA Army and Navy.340 ## Personal Ideological Promotion Xi has also elevated his position by using official speeches, publications, and Party media to paint himself as a great military strategist to whom the armed forces owe complete personal loyalty. Shortly after Xi came to power, a series of high-ranking senior PLA officers made public declarations of loyalty to him, with their statements receiving an unusual level of coverage in Party media.341 Beginning in 2016, official sources began using the title \"Commander in Chief\" in a push to paint Xi as a leader who understands and commands respect from the military, on some occasions even showing him wearing a military uniform while sitting upon a throne-like commander's chair.342 Xi has promulgated a military component of his personal ideology, so-called \"Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military,\" and his treatises are required reading for soldiers.343 State media encourage the armed forces to not only study and implement *In 2017, the PRC Constitution was amended to stipulate that the CMC chairman \"assumes overall responsibility over the work of the [CMC],\" indicating that Xi's voice almost certainly has the final say among the seven members of the CMC. Regulations on Party building in the armed forces promulgated in 2020 further stipulate that the CMC chairman must lead and command the national armed forces and determine all major issues of national defense and military building. This description reveals that the role of CMC chairman officially includes both political leadership and command authority over the armed forces.

From the mid-1980s to early 2000s, his official biography lists a series\n---\n74 ed that concentration of authority over the security forces under the CMC and CMC chairman is necessary to ensure the Party remains in control and the security forces remain loyal to it rather than the state or the nation at large. ## Political Work in China's Military: The Party Must Command the Gun Loss of Party control over the armed forces is one of several factors Xi has explicitly identified as having contributed to the fall of the CPSU and the Soviet Union, making it a matter of critical importance under his leadership.352 The November 2021 historical resolution reveals Xi's motivating concern for Party control over the armed forces: > For a period of time, the Party's leadership over the military was obviously lacking. If this problem had not been completely solved, it would not only have diminished the military's combat capacity, but also undermined the key political principle that the Party commands the gun.353 Increased emphasis on political work in the military and paramilitary under Xi's leadership has thus focused on ensuring that the armed forces' loyalty is to the Party and the Party alone.354 In emphasizing the danger of the Party losing its leadership role and control over the PLA, Xi has in part sought to combat discourse on the idea of \"nationalization\" of the PLA as a national army of the PRC rather than a Party army.355 Under Xi's predecessors, nationalization of the PLA had become a topic of discussion in some PLA circles, which Xi has openly sought to rectify.356 China's military leadership does not perceive a tradeoff between the political reliability and operational capability of its officers.357 Instead of officers being designated either \"red\" or \"expert,\" according to Mr. Lee's testimony before the Commission, \"operational proficiency and political awareness are increasingly intermingled the more senior one becomes,\" the ideal being to embody what CCP propaganda terms a \"double expert.\"358 According to testimony by James Mulvenon, former director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis at SOS International, personnel choices in the PLA are increasingly \"political choices between professional officers.\"359 In other words, he argues, political criteria are employed to choose among two or more fully qualified professional officers.360 As the military capability and professionalism of the entire PLA have risen, the system has not resulted in widespread promotion of politically reliable people at the expense of professional military competence, as is sometimes supposed.361 ## Personnel Decisions According to the PRC's Active Military Officer Service Law, the CMC chairman officially appoints and removes all active-duty offi- of Party affairs positions in the PLA, including as political commissar and Party committee secretary of a reserve unit, in a military garrison, in a military subdistrict at the municipal level, and at the provincial military district level. Finally, in a rare appointment of a civilian senior Party cadre to the powerful position of CMC vice chairman, Xi served for two years on the CMC prior to his appointment to general secretary of the Party and CMC chairman in 2012.

At the 20th Party Congress, the selection of any individual aged 68 or above to serve on the Politburo or Politburo Standing Committee likely indicates a particular interest in to remain China's top leader beyond the 21st Party Congress in 2027. Conversely, even if Xi does plan to step down in 2027, he may still refrain from publicly anointing a successor if he has concerns that doing so could provide a platform for that individual to challenge him prematurely. A decision to appoint a successor or successors could be a sign that Xi feels pressure from other leaders to identify an end date to his rule, or it could indicate he is confident enough in his political control that the identification of an eventual successor does not threaten his position in the interim. ^* No woman has ever served on the Politburo Standing Committee. There are also very few recent historical cases of uniformed military officers in the Politburo moving up to the Politburo Standing Committee level.

Since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, the age limit has been 67 (with no individuals aged 68 or older continuing to serve).

Similarly, a lowering of the retirement age may suggest a desire by the top leader to prevent the advancement of one or more individuals within the age band disqualified by the change. - Party Charter: In the past, the CCP has used the occasion of the Party Congress to add references to the top leaders' personal contributions to Party doctrine into the CCP Charter.* 464 Xi's signature contribution, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and BRI were included in the Party charter at the 19th Party Congress in 2017.465 Any additional changes that highlight the status of Xi's contributions would signal a further elevation of his personal status in the Party.466 - Speeches and Reports: The CCP's political work report\u2020 is an extremely important indicator of the new leadership's policy priorities that sets the tone for the next five years.467 After the conclusion of the Party Congress, speeches and public statements by newly selected CCP leaders are also important to observe. In the event Xi retains his leadership of the Party, the level of emphasis his major initiatives and policy slogans receive in these high-level statements will provide clues about his political standing and intentions following the Party Congress. ---- *Similar adjustments to the text of the PRC Constitution are generally made at the National People's Congress the following spring. \u2020The political work report summarizes the accomplishments of the previous Central Committee leadership and is traditionally presented by the previous general secretary at the opening of the Party Congress. It informs resolutions passed at the Party Congress itself and acts as an indicator of future policy priorities.

Poor financial, social, and environmental standards of BRI projects produced widespread international pushback after the first few years of mobilization, and China has responded to global criticism by attempting to rebrand BRI and improve its international reputation.275 Xi has personally led this effort from the top, pledging in 2018 to reorient the initiative toward poverty alleviation, green development, economic sustainability, and higher project standards.276 Official sources credit Xi with \"put[ting] forward a new requirement for the next stage of work,\" namely the new focus on \"high-quality development.\"277 A comparison of Xi's speeches before and after this adjustment also reflect a shift in messaging toward a greater emphasis on consultation, environmental impact, standards, and project quality.278 Nevertheless, this messaging shift and any accompanying adjustments to project type alter neither the overall security benefits the Chinese leadership seeks from the initiative nor its fundamental implementation process or its privileged place in China's diplomatic interactions.279 ## Global Security Initiative Xi's Global Security Initiative is another example of how major diplomatic projects are conceived, introduced, and expanded within his centralized foreign policy system. The Global Security Initiative is Xi's recently announced effort to reshape the norms of international security and make them more favorable to China, primarily by delegitimizing military alliances as a means of achieving security goals.280 (For more on the objectives of the Global Security Initiative, see Chapter 3, Section 1, \"Year in Review: Security and Foreign Affairs.\") The initiative has been described internally as a \"concrete\n---\n66 manifestation of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy,\" linking it to Xi's broader vision and instructions for the conduct of China's foreign affairs.281 As a relatively recent initiative, it provides a window into the process of continuous policy development under Xi whereby new initiatives are built upon the foundation of his previously established concepts. Like BRI, the Global Security Initiative is a framework Xi introduced to guide China's foreign policy that is being carried out and elaborated upon through top-down Party leadership. It was introduced as a relatively broad concept by Xi himself at the Boao Forum for Asia* on April 21, 2022.282 Xi's speech laid out six major elements of the initiative, which have since been officially designated the \"six commitments.\"\u2020283 In the months since the Global Security Initiative's introduction, the \"six commitments\" have been faithfully echoed in other Party and government sources and gradually rolled out in diplomatic statements around the globe.284 Although the Global Security Initiative is still in its earliest stages, Dr. Greitens assessed in her testimony that it is likely to closely follow the pattern set by Xi's other named initiatives over the upcoming one to two years as the various levels of the Party-state work to transform Xi's initial directive into concrete policies.285 Policy concepts and Party structures Xi has put in place already appear to have played a leading role in the development of the new initiative. As Dr. Greitens explained in her testimony for the Commission, the Global Security Initiative should be understood as the international projection of Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept that centers on regime security.286 Although the initiative has not yet been widely presented as such abroad, authoritative Chinese sources are very explicit about this framing and argue that Xi's national security concept forms the \"theoretical foundation\" for the Global Security Initiative.287 For example, the Global Security Initiative is referred to as \"a vivid practice for guiding China's diplomatic work based on the Comprehensive National Security Concept\" and a \"further enrich[ment of] the 'world chapter' of the Comprehensive National Security Concept.\"288 Based on an assessment of its publications in 2022, a particular Party-affiliated research organization known as the Comprehensive National Security Concept Research Center also appears to have played a leading role in both laying the theoretical groundwork for and fleshing out the initial details of the Global Security Initiative.289 The organization was founded on April 14, 2021, with the mandate to develop and promote *The Boao Forum for Asia is an international organization with a mission of promoting economic integration and advancing development in Asia, headquartered in Boao in Hainan, China. Boao Forum for Asia, \"About BFA,\" 2021\u20132022. \u2020The \"six commitments\" are: (1) \"staying committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security\"; (2) \"staying committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries\"; (3) \"staying committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter\"; (4) \"staying committed to taking seriously the legitimate security concerns of all countries\"; (5) \"staying committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation\"; and (6) \"staying committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains.\" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Global Security Initiative\u2014China's Latest Contribution to Peace and Development in a Changing World, May 19, 2022; Wang Yi, \"Implement the Global Security Initiative, Safeguard World Peace and Tranquility\" (\u843d\u5b9e\u5168\u7403\u5b89\u5168\u5021\u8bae\uff0c\u5b88\u62a4\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5e73\u5b89\u5b81), People's Daily, April 24, 2022.

Although Chi-\nna's foreign policy apparatus is also capable of making adjustments,\nsuch changes must still be centrally directed and may even be large-\nly cosmetic in nature, reflecting a change in the top's assessment of\nthe best way to reach a consistent goal rather than a fundamental\npolicy reorientation. The Global Security Initiative further illumi-\nnates the lasting effect of Xi's initiatives by illustrating how new\npolicies can continue to grow out of the foundational ideas and in-\nstitutions Xi created. ## Military Decision-Making China's decision-making on the use of its military and paramili-\ntary forces is highly centralized and increasingly personalized. Com-\nmand authority for China's military and paramilitary forces rests\nwith the CMC, the CCP Central Committee's designated military\npolicy body.* Under General Secretary Xi, reforms increased cen-\ntralization and vested more responsibility and final decision-mak-\ning power in Xi himself. Consequently, the goals and use of China's\nmilitary and paramilitary forces are subject to immense personal\ndiscretion by Xi, particularly in crisis situations. CCP leaders con-\ntinuously scrutinize the military's loyalty, with several reforms and\nincreased emphasis on \"political work\" in the military and paramili-\ntary forces designed to strengthen loyalty to the Party and ultimate-\nly to Xi himself. This combination of central control and emphasis\non political loyalty leads to micromanagement and inefficiency in\nsome areas of military decision-making.\n---\n\nChunk 2\nSource: CCP_Decision_Making_Xi_Chapter1_Feb2025.md\n---\n*In his work entitled \"On the People's Democratic Dictatorship,\" Mao Zedong defined the \"peo-\nple's democratic dictatorship\" as the exercise of \"democracy within the people\" and \"dictatorship\nover the reactionaries.\" He explains that \"the people\" who support China's socialist revolution\nshould enjoy political freedoms, whereas the enemies of the revolution should be constrained\nand oppressed.

The overall goal of these efforts appears to have been centralizing Party control while simultaneously preventing the reemergence of any position powerful enough to challenge the top leadership. Lines of effort have included a realignment of the Party's existing CPLAC and its associated hierarchy;* the subordination of political-legal work to Xi's newly defined national security goals and institutions; an ongoing series of campaigns to ensure loyalty from the system's leaders and personnel; and relentless promotion of Xi's leading role in political-security work. ## Reorientation and Subordination of the CPLAC In contrast to elevating the bureaucratic status of other key Party commissions, Xi lowered the bureaucratic status of the CPLAC even while expanding its areas of authority to centralize Party control. This anomaly was likely intended to prevent any leader of the domestic security apparatus from developing a unique power base. Following Zhou Yongkang's expulsion from the Party, his former portfolio as head of the CPLAC was immediately downgraded from the Politburo Standing Committee level, where it had been since the early 2000s, to the Politburo level.404 The demotion would severely limit the ability of any future commission head to contravene the decisions of the top CCP leadership the way Zhou had attempted. The CCP also began to phase out the dual-hatting of local-level political-legal committee heads as the heads of local public security bureaus.405 This reversed a practice that had become common since the late 1990s and 2000s and that had allowed the local political-legal organs to play an extremely active role in local domestic security affairs.406 With these changes in place, the CPLAC's areas of responsibility could be safely expanded as part of the broad Party-state reorganization effort. In March 2018, the CCP consolidated responsibility for additional channels of political-legal work within the CPLAC by directing it to absorb the majority of the functions of three other Party leading small groups and commissions.407 These were the Central Commission on Comprehensive Management of Societal Security, the Central Leading Small Group on Maintaining Stability Work, and the Central Leading Small Group for the Prevention and Handling of Cult Issues.\u2020408 ruption struggle on the political and legal fronts is still grim.

Minxin Pei, \"The CCP's Domestic Security Taskmaster: The Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission,\" China Leadership Monitor (September 1, 2021): 3\u201312. \u2020The CPLAC absorbed all of the functions of the first two organizations, the Central Commission on Comprehensive Management of Societal Security and the Central Leading Small Group on Maintaining Stability Work. In the case of the third organization, the Central Leading Small Group for the Prevention and Handling of Cult Issues, the CPLAC took on the disbanded group's decision-making responsibilities while the MPS absorbed some of its administrative and implementation functions. The reorganization plan assigned responsibility for information gathering, analysis, and policy implementation to the MPS as a government ministry, whereas the CPLAC as a Party organization was tasked with policy coordination and making policy recommendations\n---\n80 Like other parts of the bureaucracy under Xi, the CPLAC and its associated hierarchy also appear to have been subject to the overall authority of the CNSC and its hierarchy. Following the establishment of the CNSC under Xi's leadership, experts have predicted that the new national security commission may supplant the leadership of the existing political-legal commission over domestic security issues.409 While the full details of the relationship between the two Party groups remain unknown, there are several indicators that the political-legal affairs organizations are required to follow the leadership of the CNSC. First, as previously indicated, the head of the CPLAC is currently a Politburo-level position, whereas the head of the CNSC is Xi himself. Second, the last available list of the full membership of the CNSC, which dates from 2017, includes the head of the CPLAC (then Meng Jianzhu) as a member of the CNSC, along with the Minister of Public Security.410 Third, new regulations released in 2019 require that political-legal work \"adhere to the Comprehensive National Security Concept\" and explicitly direct lower-level political-legal committees to \"implement the decisions and arrangements\" of central and local national security commission leadership organizations at every level.411 Personnel Changes Xi has also gone to great lengths to ensure the loyalty of the political-legal apparatus by replacing most of its leadership, many by means of the anticorruption campaign, with people he trusts.412 According to Dr. Wu, since taking power in 2012 Xi has presided over at least three purges of the MPS and political-legal apparatus.413 The first wave centered around the removal of Zhou Yongkang along with many of Zhou's proteges and much of the leadership of the MPS. According to Dr. Wu, to accomplish this feat so early in his time as general secretary, Xi relied on support from not only Wang Qishan (then in charge of the CCP's Central Discipline-Inspection Committee) but also several other groups of officials both inside and outside the public security apparatus.* 414 Dr. Wu assesses that the ensuing purges in 2018 and 2020 have represented \"an ongoing process of power redistribution\" among those groups, with each wave bringing to power individuals with closer ties to Xi than those who had come before.415 The Party under Xi has demonstrated a strong focus on managing and developing the political quality of both the leaders in the system and the rank-and-file public security personnel. A readout of Xi's guiding speech in January 2015 states, \"It is necessary to strengthen and improve the leadership of political-legal work; choose to the CCP Central Committee.

Misallocated resources have led total factor productivity growth (an economist's primary measure of economic efficiency) to drop precipitously from an average of 3.5 percent in the 2000s to only 0.7 percent in the 2010s, at the same time total debt has ballooned. 144 It is increasingly evident to those inside and outside Beijing that a decisive economic slowdown is unavoidable and happening. These unwelcomed realities have only added urgency to Xi's centralization drive as he seeks to make a virtue out of necessity: concentrating control to not only cut off local governments and vested interests from piling up debts in unproductive sectors but also steer resource allocation in centrally approved directions. As Beijing deepens a belated effort to cut off credit to old growth drivers, principally real estate construction activities, these moves have become embedded in a larger, politicized effort to shift China's growth model from \"quantity\" to \"quality,\" wherein investment is channeled in accordance with a top-down definition of \"quality\" that conspicuously serves Xi's modernization drive.

GDP targets, however, have been replaced by a \"confusing welter of political, social, and environmental mandates,\" according to Andrew Batson, director for China research at economic research firm Gavekal. The shift has led officials and enterprises to adhere more closely to signals from Beijing than the market.\u00b9\u2074\u2075 Rather than liberal market reform, Xi's \"grand project to reorient the Communist Party's mobilizational machinery away from the pursuit of economic growth and toward a broader set of goals, which can be summarized as the pursuit of 'national greatness' \" is instead far more \"consistent with Xi's renewed focus on ideology and political discipline.\"\u00b9\u2074\u2076 ## The Structures of Economic Decision-Making under Xi Xi is revivifying formal Leninist structures to discipline and control lower-level economic decision-making, enforce adherence to central directives, deepen the Party's penetration into all aspects of the economy, and expand and deploy macroeconomic policy planning and guidance. Structures of economic decision-making under Xi can be segmented into two areas: (1) discipline, command, and control of the Party and state bureaucracies; and (2) increased penetration and efforts to steer the nonstate sector. Xi aims to overcome the structural challenge of exerting control over a sprawling economic system, enormous geographical expanse, and massive population by conditioning the bureaucracy, local officials, state-owned enterprises, and\u2014increasingly\u2014nonstate actors to faithfully enact his nationalist modernization plans. Xi's address to the 19th Party Congress stressed the importance of developing the Party so the Party can guide the country and the economy toward modernization.\u00b9\u2074\u2077 This belief will continue to animate Xi's agenda at and beyond the 20th Party Congress. *The 19th Party Congress was the locus of a major change in this direction, as Xi altered the CCP's \"principal contradiction\" facing Chinese society away from Deng's \"ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people and backward social production\" and to his own \"unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs for a better life.\" As Neil Thomas explained in his testimony, this change in the \"principal contradiction\" is an arcane but extremely important aspect of China's governance.

Xi has also empowered Party organs he more directly controls to reclaim command over economic policymaking and implementation processes that had devolved to the State Council, enabling his influence over economic policy to far outpace that of Li Keqiang who, as premier of the State Council, would historically have had more power over economic matters.\u2020 150 The two most important Party entities for economic policy-making in China, both upgraded from leading small groups to commissions in March 2018, are the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission.151 The former, although not principally focused on economics, is nonetheless the most important commission impacting economic policy. Nis Gr\u00fcnberg, lead analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies and an expert on China's governance, called the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission the \"powerhouse for Xi Jinping's 'top-level design' policymaking, issuing policy on a broad array of topics, including economic issues.\"152 The Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission outranks ministries and commands more political clout than China's State *Resources and personnel were syphoned away from functional ministries to staff these now expanded bodies, likely leading to \"larger permanent staff and even their own office buildings.\" Victor Shih, written testimony for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 2. \u2020Prior premiers, such as Zhu Rongji, have been given the latitude to oversee momentous economic policy programs, including banking system reorganization and state-owned enterprise reform. Beyond the structural changes, recent Party proceedings further point to the sidelining of the State Council and its leadership in matters of economic affairs.

Purges of several high-level officials have included former Secretary of the Central Political-Legal Affairs Commission and member of the Politburo Standing Committee Zhou Yongkang and two former vice chairmen of the CMC, among others.64 In targeting such officials, the campaign allowed Xi to increase his popular appeal by rooting out egregious corruption of China's political elite.65 It also enabled Xi to sideline rivals and instill fear of running afoul of his preferences throughout the Party's upper and lower ranks.66 The campaign and associated discipline inspections have been gradually institutionalized and now serve as tools to ensure adherence to Xi's policy agenda across all levels of government. In late 2016, the CCP's Central Committee launched pilot supervisory commissions in the Beijing municipality and Shanxi and Zhejiang provinces, leading to the establishment of a National Supervisory Commission that integrated the anticorruption functions of several government organizations.67 This commission ultimately joined with the Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the CCP's top disciplinary body, at the 2018 Two Sessions.68 The new National Supervisory Commission formalized Xi's anticorruption campaign and equipped the CCP with\n---\n36 ## Anticorruption Campaign and Discipline Inspections as Tools of Governance\u2014Continued oversight of China's wider government bureaucracy and public officials, including non-Party members that were formerly beyond the CCDI's jurisdiction.69 These increased intragovernmental and intraparty coordination efforts have been complemented by changes to laws, regulations, and Party strictures to further formalize the campaign.70 The anticorruption campaign's long-term persistence, expansion, and institutionalization provide increased evidence of its underlying political motivation and Xi's intention to use it as a multipurpose governing tool.71 As Xi's efforts to root out corruption and bolster Party discipline become more formalized, investigations are reaching down deeper into the Party's rank and file and becoming a means of governance. The number of corruption cases at or below the county level grew nearly 20 percent from 523,000 in 2017 to 624,000 in 2021.72 According to think tank MacroPolo's analysis of CCDI discipline inspections from 2019 to 2021, performance-related cases* made up 54 percent of cases investigated, compared with 46 percent for financial corruption, suggesting the CCP is attempting to shape cadre behavior to ensure they perform their duties.73 These shifts toward larger numbers of investigations into lower-level cadres seem to point to an increased emphasis on ensuring broadbased responsiveness to the Party center.74 There is also evidence that the ever-present threat of inspection has resulted in higher levels of risk aversion among local-level bureaucrats.\u2020 ## Xi as the Core of CCP Decision-Making Over the past decade, Xi has consolidated power and elevated his personal authority over the Party to an extent not seen since Mao Zedong.75 First, Xi took control of the Party, state, and military more quickly than Jiang Zeming or Hu Jintao, becoming CCP general secretary and chairman of the CMC in November 2012 and state chairman in March 2013.\u2021 Then in 2016, only three years into Xi's *The institutionalization of the National Supervision Commission within the CCDI is resulting in a more concerted effort to modify cadre behavior and ensure they implement the top CCP leadership's policy agenda. Since 2018, the CCDI has stressed the importance of \"addressing bureaucratic inefficiency,\" with inspections now focusing on officials' failure to implement Party directives or the adoption of a lax work style, such as holding too many meetings and side-stepping administrative duties. Ruihan Huang and Joshua Henderson, \"From Fear to Behavior Modification: Beijing Entrenches Corruption Fight,\" MacroPolo, March 8, 2022. \u2020In a study on the anticorruption campaign's impact on local-level governance, Erik H. Wang, assistant professor of political science at the Australian National University, found disciplinary inspections and anticorruption activities made local-level bureaucrats more risk averse. Dr. Wang used local government land auctions as an indicator of local bureaucrats' governance activity, as these auctions typically drive infrastructure development. According to Dr. Wang's findings, provincial disciplinary inspections were followed in the subsequent month by a 15 percent decline in land development projects proposed by bureaucrats in the inspected province.

The overall goal of these efforts appears to have been centralizing Party control while simultaneously preventing the reemergence of any position powerful enough to challenge the top leadership. Lines of effort have included a realignment of the Party's existing CPLAC and its associated hierarchy;* the subordination of political-legal work to Xi's newly defined national security goals and institutions; an ongoing series of campaigns to ensure loyalty from the system's leaders and personnel; and relentless promotion of Xi's leading role in political-security work. ## Reorientation and Subordination of the CPLAC In contrast to elevating the bureaucratic status of other key Party commissions, Xi lowered the bureaucratic status of the CPLAC even while expanding its areas of authority to centralize Party control. This anomaly was likely intended to prevent any leader of the domestic security apparatus from developing a unique power base. Following Zhou Yongkang's expulsion from the Party, his former portfolio as head of the CPLAC was immediately downgraded from the Politburo Standing Committee level, where it had been since the early 2000s, to the Politburo level.404 The demotion would severely limit the ability of any future commission head to contravene the decisions of the top CCP leadership the way Zhou had attempted. The CCP also began to phase out the dual-hatting of local-level political-legal committee heads as the heads of local public security bureaus.405 This reversed a practice that had become common since the late 1990s and 2000s and that had allowed the local political-legal organs to play an extremely active role in local domestic security affairs.406 With these changes in place, the CPLAC's areas of responsibility could be safely expanded as part of the broad Party-state reorganization effort. In March 2018, the CCP consolidated responsibility for additional channels of political-legal work within the CPLAC by directing it to absorb the majority of the functions of three other Party leading small groups and commissions.407 These were the Central Commission on Comprehensive Management of Societal Security, the Central Leading Small Group on Maintaining Stability Work, and the Central Leading Small Group for the Prevention and Handling of Cult Issues.\u2020408 ruption struggle on the political and legal fronts is still grim.

Translation. *The CPLAC sits atop a hierarchy of lower-level political-legal committees that manage political-legal work at the provincial and local levels. Minxin Pei, \"The CCP's Domestic Security Taskmaster: The Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission,\" China Leadership Monitor (September 1, 2021): 3\u201312. \u2020The CPLAC absorbed all of the functions of the first two organizations, the Central Commission on Comprehensive Management of Societal Security and the Central Leading Small Group on Maintaining Stability Work. In the case of the third organization, the Central Leading Small Group for the Prevention and Handling of Cult Issues, the CPLAC took on the disbanded group's decision-making responsibilities while the MPS absorbed some of its administrative and implementation functions. The reorganization plan assigned responsibility for information gathering, analysis, and policy implementation to the MPS as a government ministry, whereas the CPLAC as a Party organization was tasked with policy coordination and making policy recommendations\n---\n80 Like other parts of the bureaucracy under Xi, the CPLAC and its associated hierarchy also appear to have been subject to the overall authority of the CNSC and its hierarchy. Following the establishment of the CNSC under Xi's leadership, experts have predicted that the new national security commission may supplant the leadership of the existing political-legal commission over domestic security issues.409 While the full details of the relationship between the two Party groups remain unknown, there are several indicators that the political-legal affairs organizations are required to follow the leadership of the CNSC. First, as previously indicated, the head of the CPLAC is currently a Politburo-level position, whereas the head of the CNSC is Xi himself. Second, the last available list of the full membership of the CNSC, which dates from 2017, includes the head of the CPLAC (then Meng Jianzhu) as a member of the CNSC, along with the Minister of Public Security.410 Third, new regulations released in 2019 require that political-legal work \"adhere to the Comprehensive National Security Concept\" and explicitly direct lower-level political-legal committees to \"implement the decisions and arrangements\" of central and local national security commission leadership organizations at every level.411 Personnel Changes Xi has also gone to great lengths to ensure the loyalty of the political-legal apparatus by replacing most of its leadership, many by means of the anticorruption campaign, with people he trusts.412 According to Dr. Wu, since taking power in 2012 Xi has presided over at least three purges of the MPS and political-legal apparatus.413 The first wave centered around the removal of Zhou Yongkang along with many of Zhou's proteges and much of the leadership of the MPS. According to Dr. Wu, to accomplish this feat so early in his time as general secretary, Xi relied on support from not only Wang Qishan (then in charge of the CCP's Central Discipline-Inspection Committee) but also several other groups of officials both inside and outside the public security apparatus.* 414 Dr. Wu assesses that the ensuing purges in 2018 and 2020 have represented \"an ongoing process of power redistribution\" among those groups, with each wave bringing to power individuals with closer ties to Xi than those who had come before.415 The Party under Xi has demonstrated a strong focus on managing and developing the political quality of both the leaders in the system and the rank-and-file public security personnel. A readout of Xi's guiding speech in January 2015 states, \"It is necessary to strengthen and improve the leadership of political-legal work; choose to the CCP Central Committee. CCP Central Committee, Plan for Deepening the Reform of Party and State Agencies (\u4e2d\u5171\u4e2d\u592e\u5370\u53d1\u300a\u6df1\u5316\u515a\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u673a\u6784\u6539\u9769\u65b9\u6848\u300b), March 21, 2018.

Under Mao Zedong, for\nexample, the Party Central Committee formed a five-person and then a ten-person leading small\ngroup to guide the 1955 campaign to \"suppress counterrevolutionaries.\" As the Party moved to a\ncollective leadership model with a consensus approach to decision-making, leading small groups\ngradually became more policy focused and led by different members of the Politburo Standing\nCommittee. The CCP has also established task-oriented, short-term groups in response to policy\ncrises. On January 25, 2020, the Central Committee established a new central leading group on\npandemic response as CCP leaders finally publicly acknowledged the severity of the COVID-19\noutbreak in Wuhan.

Purges of several high-level officials have included former Secretary of the Central Political-Legal Affairs Commission and member of the Politburo Standing Committee Zhou Yongkang and two former vice chairmen of the CMC, among others.64 In targeting such officials, the campaign allowed Xi to increase his popular appeal by rooting out egregious corruption of China's political elite.65 It also enabled Xi to sideline rivals and instill fear of running afoul of his preferences throughout the Party's upper and lower ranks.66 The campaign and associated discipline inspections have been gradually institutionalized and now serve as tools to ensure adherence to Xi's policy agenda across all levels of government. In late 2016, the CCP's Central Committee launched pilot supervisory commissions in the Beijing municipality and Shanxi and Zhejiang provinces, leading to the establishment of a National Supervisory Commission that integrated the anticorruption functions of several government organizations.67 This commission ultimately joined with the Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the CCP's top disciplinary body, at the 2018 Two Sessions.68 The new National Supervisory Commission formalized Xi's anticorruption campaign and equipped the CCP with\n---\n36 ## Anticorruption Campaign and Discipline Inspections as Tools of Governance\u2014Continued oversight of China's wider government bureaucracy and public officials, including non-Party members that were formerly beyond the CCDI's jurisdiction.69 These increased intragovernmental and intraparty coordination efforts have been complemented by changes to laws, regulations, and Party strictures to further formalize the campaign.70 The anticorruption campaign's long-term persistence, expansion, and institutionalization provide increased evidence of its underlying political motivation and Xi's intention to use it as a multipurpose governing tool.71 As Xi's efforts to root out corruption and bolster Party discipline become more formalized, investigations are reaching down deeper into the Party's rank and file and becoming a means of governance. The number of corruption cases at or below the county level grew nearly 20 percent from 523,000 in 2017 to 624,000 in 2021.72 According to think tank MacroPolo's analysis of CCDI discipline inspections from 2019 to 2021, performance-related cases* made up 54 percent of cases investigated, compared with 46 percent for financial corruption, suggesting the CCP is attempting to shape cadre behavior to ensure they perform their duties.73 These shifts toward larger numbers of investigations into lower-level cadres seem to point to an increased emphasis on ensuring broadbased responsiveness to the Party center.74 There is also evidence that the ever-present threat of inspection has resulted in higher levels of risk aversion among local-level bureaucrats.\u2020 ## Xi as the Core of CCP Decision-Making Over the past decade, Xi has consolidated power and elevated his personal authority over the Party to an extent not seen since Mao Zedong.75 First, Xi took control of the Party, state, and military more quickly than Jiang Zeming or Hu Jintao, becoming CCP general secretary and chairman of the CMC in November 2012 and state chairman in March 2013.\u2021 Then in 2016, only three years into Xi's *The institutionalization of the National Supervision Commission within the CCDI is resulting in a more concerted effort to modify cadre behavior and ensure they implement the top CCP leadership's policy agenda. Since 2018, the CCDI has stressed the importance of \"addressing bureaucratic inefficiency,\" with inspections now focusing on officials' failure to implement Party directives or the adoption of a lax work style, such as holding too many meetings and side-stepping administrative duties. Ruihan Huang and Joshua Henderson, \"From Fear to Behavior Modification: Beijing Entrenches Corruption Fight,\" MacroPolo, March 8, 2022. \u2020In a study on the anticorruption campaign's impact on local-level governance, Erik H. Wang, assistant professor of political science at the Australian National University, found disciplinary inspections and anticorruption activities made local-level bureaucrats more risk averse. Dr. Wang used local government land auctions as an indicator of local bureaucrats' governance activity, as these auctions typically drive infrastructure development. According to Dr. Wang's findings, provincial disciplinary inspections were followed in the subsequent month by a 15 percent decline in land development projects proposed by bureaucrats in the inspected province.

Because the CMC chairman is the only individual to sit on both the Politburo Standing Committee and the CMC, the position gives Xi sole responsibility for coordination between the two most powerful bodies in the Party.335 Xi has also worked to strengthen the position's authority by placing a renewed emphasis on the \"Chairman Responsibility System,\" a stipulation in the 1982 PRC Constitution that grants ultimate authority for military affairs to the CMC chairman.336 Under Xi's predecessors Jiang and Hu, the CMC's two uniformed vice chairmen took responsibility for the majority of CMC decision-making on the chairman's behalf in a pattern that became known as the \"Vice Chairman Responsibility System.\"337 Xi identified this arrangement as a major contributor to a trend of excessive PLA autonomy and has done away with it in favor of concentrating power in his own hands.338 A 2017 amendment to the PRC Constitution and a 2020 military regulation on political work cemented this status by giving Xi final say in all CMC work and the ability to set the military's agenda on all political and operational issues.*339 According to Mr. Lee's assessment in his testimony for the Commission, the anecdotal evidence available by cataloguing Xi's military meeting agenda since becoming CMC chairman in 2012 suggests he is particularly involved in decision-making on defining PLA reform milestones and objectives, transforming the Southern Theater Command into a modern joint operations command organization, and modernizing the PLA Army and Navy.340 ## Personal Ideological Promotion Xi has also elevated his position by using official speeches, publications, and Party media to paint himself as a great military strategist to whom the armed forces owe complete personal loyalty. Shortly after Xi came to power, a series of high-ranking senior PLA officers made public declarations of loyalty to him, with their statements receiving an unusual level of coverage in Party media.341 Beginning in 2016, official sources began using the title \"Commander in Chief\" in a push to paint Xi as a leader who understands and commands respect from the military, on some occasions even showing him wearing a military uniform while sitting upon a throne-like commander's chair.342 Xi has promulgated a military component of his personal ideology, so-called \"Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military,\" and his treatises are required reading for soldiers.343 State media encourage the armed forces to not only study and implement *In 2017, the PRC Constitution was amended to stipulate that the CMC chairman \"assumes overall responsibility over the work of the [CMC],\" indicating that Xi's voice almost certainly has the final say among the seven members of the CMC. Regulations on Party building in the armed forces promulgated in 2020 further stipulate that the CMC chairman must lead and command the national armed forces and determine all major issues of national defense and military building. This description reveals that the role of CMC chairman officially includes both political leadership and command authority over the armed forces.

If this problem had not been completely solved, it would not only have diminished the military's combat capacity, but also undermined the key political principle that the Party commands the gun.353 Increased emphasis on political work in the military and paramilitary under Xi's leadership has thus focused on ensuring that the armed forces' loyalty is to the Party and the Party alone.354 In emphasizing the danger of the Party losing its leadership role and control over the PLA, Xi has in part sought to combat discourse on the idea of \"nationalization\" of the PLA as a national army of the PRC rather than a Party army.355 Under Xi's predecessors, nationalization of the PLA had become a topic of discussion in some PLA circles, which Xi has openly sought to rectify.356 China's military leadership does not perceive a tradeoff between the political reliability and operational capability of its officers.357 Instead of officers being designated either \"red\" or \"expert,\" according to Mr. Lee's testimony before the Commission, \"operational proficiency and political awareness are increasingly intermingled the more senior one becomes,\" the ideal being to embody what CCP propaganda terms a \"double expert.\"358 According to testimony by James Mulvenon, former director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis at SOS International, personnel choices in the PLA are increasingly \"political choices between professional officers.\"359 In other words, he argues, political criteria are employed to choose among two or more fully qualified professional officers.360 As the military capability and professionalism of the entire PLA have risen, the system has not resulted in widespread promotion of politically reliable people at the expense of professional military competence, as is sometimes supposed.361 ## Personnel Decisions According to the PRC's Active Military Officer Service Law, the CMC chairman officially appoints and removes all active-duty offi- of Party affairs positions in the PLA, including as political commissar and Party committee secretary of a reserve unit, in a military garrison, in a military subdistrict at the municipal level, and at the provincial military district level. Finally, in a rare appointment of a civilian senior Party cadre to the powerful position of CMC vice chairman, Xi served for two years on the CMC prior to his appointment to general secretary of the Party and CMC chairman in 2012.

At the 20th Party Congress, the selection of any individual aged 68 or above to serve on the Politburo or Politburo Standing Committee likely indicates a particular interest in to remain China's top leader beyond the 21st Party Congress in 2027. Conversely, even if Xi does plan to step down in 2027, he may still refrain from publicly anointing a successor if he has concerns that doing so could provide a platform for that individual to challenge him prematurely. A decision to appoint a successor or successors could be a sign that Xi feels pressure from other leaders to identify an end date to his rule, or it could indicate he is confident enough in his political control that the identification of an eventual successor does not threaten his position in the interim. ^* No woman has ever served on the Politburo Standing Committee.

Decisions to adjust course on China's policy choices most likely must be initiated or approved by either Xi or potentially the head of a relevant Party commission. Similarly, Xi's unparalleled authority and wide discretion on military affairs make it difficult to reliably predict or influence the decisions he will make or which interlocutors he will involve in decisions. This is particularly the case in a crisis situation, when he may have less time or desire to confer with other leaders before making a decision. It also means external pressure can only be effective if faithfully conveyed to key Party decision-making bodies for consideration. Typically high-sounding state positions like minister of foreign affairs and minister of defense are a full step away from the Party leaders making decisions in their areas of responsibility. The recentralization of decision-making power within the CCP under Xi's leadership accompanies tighter CCP supervision of the entire Party-state bureaucracy to ensure adherence with Xi's policy choices. As a result, the CCP can ensure rapid mobilization of resources to advance Xi's policy objectives and execution of his decisions, but it may also limit the CCP's ability to correct its policy mistakes or adjust course. This inability to adjust course regardless of economic and security implications poses a challenge to U.S. strategic planning and responses. This may be particularly relevant in late 2022, when the CCP will reshuffle its leadership. Economic headwinds buffeting the Chinese economy are occurring just as Xi prepares to extend his leadership over the CCP at the 20th Party Congress. This politically sensitive year may push Xi to dismiss the economic costs of his policy choices as he looks to protect his position. Finally, even though the state bodies have always been led by CCP officials and subject to Party guidance, China's policy increasingly grows out of Party structures and under the auspices of Party leaders who are concerned with ensuring the Party's continued supremacy. Effective assessments of China's strategic intent must take into account the worldview and organizational limitations of the CCP as well as the material objectives the Party judges might best suit \"China\" as a whole. Furthermore, because all major policy decisions made by Xi are now couched in uncompromising national security terms, the United States and other countries seeking to defend their own interests in interactions with China should anticipate and plan for vocal or even coercive retaliation against actions the CCP is likely to interpret as harmful to its interests.\n---\n86 # Appendix: The CCP's 2022 20th National Congress ## Introduction - **Party Congress Overview:** The CCP's National Congress, usually referred to simply as the \"Party Congress,\" convenes every five years to determine the leadership positions within the CCP.*441 As of this report's writing, the CCP's 20th Party Congress is scheduled to begin on October 16, 2022.442 The event will determine key players in the Party system and set the tone and agenda for China's policymaking for at least the next five years.443 - **Xi's Intentions for the 20th Party Congress:** At this year's 20th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi likely will seek to extend his leadership of the CCP, place additional individuals he trusts in positions of power, further elevate his political profile through amendments to the Party charter, further entrench his policy agenda through speeches and high-level documents, and continue the process of adjusting institutional arrangements of power within the Party.444 ## Party Congress Process - **Sequence of Events:** The roughly 2,300 delegates\u2020 participating in the Party Congress will convene in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.445 The delegates will select the new CCP Central Committee and the Central Committee for Discipline Inspection in a modestly competitive process.\u2021446 When the selection process is complete, a list of the new Central Committee Members and Alternate Members will be distributed and circulated to the media.\u00a7447 Immediately following the conclusion of the Congress, usually on the following day, the newly selected Central Committee con- *The turnover of CCP positions at the Party Congress is only one of the two major events that determine the national leadership of China's Party-state system. It is followed by the turnover of state positions in the meeting of the National People's Congress in the next spring. Thus, the process of leadership turnover begun at the 20th Party Congress in the fall of 2022 will not be completed until the conclusion of the National People's Congress in March 2023. Yew Lun Tian, \"Factbox: How China's Communist Party Congress Works,\" Reuters, October 14, 2022; Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, \"China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress,\" Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 23. \u2020According to Xinhua, delegates represent 38 provinces and other provincial-level entities (autonomous regions, centrally administered municipalities, and special administrative regions), certain central authorities, the central financial sector, and Beijing-based centrally administered state-owned enterprises. The election process for delegates includes five steps Xinhua describes as \"the nomination of candidates by Party members; a nominee review; public notification of the candidates for feedback; candidate shortlists; and the final vote in each electoral unit.\" Xinhua, \"How CPC Elects Delegates to Upcoming Party Congress,\" April 23, 2022. \u2021At the CCP's last Party Congress in October 2017, delegates selected 204 candidates out of a list of 222 for full membership on the Central Committee. Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, \"China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress,\" Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 9\u201310. \u00a7According to Susan Lawrence, specialist in Asian Affairs at the Congressional Research Service, if Xi's name is included in this list of Central Committee Members, it is an indication he will likely be selected for a third term as CCP general secretary, as the position of general secretary can only be held by a member of the Central Committee. If Xi's name does not appear on this list, it is an advance indication that he will not retain the position of general secretary. This could mean either that he is expected to step down entirely or that he will take a different approach to remaining in power that does not require him to be a member of the Central Committee. This was the approach taken by Jiang Zemin in 2002 when he relinquished the position of general secretary to Hu Jintao but retained the position of CMC chairman. Susan Lawrence, remarks at \"Toward Xi's Third Term: China's 20th Party Congress and Beyond,\" January 20, 2022, 29.\n---\n87 venes its first plenary session.448 It is at this meeting that the new Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee, general secretary, and CMC are selected.449 After the conclusion of the Central Committee's first plenary session, the newly selected Politburo Standing Committee, headed by the general secretary, have in the past been revealed in rank order at a live, televised press conference.450 - Indicators of Xi's Influence on the Process: At the 17th and 18th Party Congresses in 2007 and 2012, Hu Jintao's Administration conducted straw polls for Central Committee members to express their opinions on candidates for the Politburo.451 Although the results of these polls were secret and nonbinding, they reportedly did influence the ultimate selection of Politburo members.452 At the 19th Party Congress, by contrast, Xi replaced straw polls with face-to-face consultations.453 Given an emphasis in Party media on the delegates' need to uphold Xi's position as the core of the Central Committee and the Party, Xi may have used his influence to adjust the process in his favor in the runup to the 20th Party Congress.454 ## Outcomes to Watch in 2022 - Xi's Position and Title: The most visible and consequential outcome of the 20th Party Congress will be a determination of Xi's status as the top leader of the CCP. Xi is widely expected to break with recent precedent and remain at the head of the CCP beyond the 20th Party Congress,* potentially securing a third term as CCP general secretary. Some analysts have even suggested Xi may use the occasion of the 20th Party Congress to claim the position of \"CCP chairman,\" which was abolished shortly after the death of Mao Zedong.455 Any continuation of Xi's leadership would likely presage a continuation and intensification of his existing policy agenda. His resignation or removal would mark a significant shift in China's political landscape. - Succession: In the event Xi remains the Party's top leader, another important outcome will be whether he identifies one or more potential successors. At the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, Xi broke with recent precedent by not indicating any presumptive successors.\u2020 456 Continued silence on this issue at the 20th Party Congress would intensify existing concerns about the potential for instability in the hypothetical event of Xi's untimely demise or departure from power.457 It may also provide clues into Xi's intended tenure at the top of the system or his level of confidence in his political control.\u2021 *The position of CCP general secretary does not have an explicit term limit, but Xi's two immediate predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, served only two five-year terms. By this precedent, Xi, who became general secretary in 2012, would be expected to step down at the 20th Party Congress in 2022. Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, \"China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress,\" Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 11. \u2020Xi was identified alongside Li Keqiang as one of Hu Jintao's two presumptive successors at the 17th Party Congress in 2007, which began Hu's second term as general secretary. Hu was similarly anointed as the \"heir apparent\" to his predecessor Jiang Zemin in 1992. Congressional Research Service, \"China's 17th Communist Party Congress, 2007: Leadership and Policy Implications,\" EveryCRSReport.com, December 5, 2007; Cheng Li, \"China: Riding Two Horses at Once,\" Brookings Institution, October 23, 2007. \u2021The meaning of this decision could nonetheless be interpreted multiple ways. A decision not to designate any successors could be interpreted as a signal of Xi's confidence and his intention\n---\n88 - Appointments: Appointments to the CCP's Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee will likely reveal key supporters of the CCP top leader. Assessing the level of adherence to informal retirement and promotional norms for these senior positions could also provide clues about the top leader's political capital to advance his allies. - Politburo Standing Committee: Most new appointments to the Politburo Standing Committee have historically come from the ranks of the previous Politburo.^458 From within the Politburo, male, nonmilitary members below the prevailing retirement age have accounted for most of the promotions.^* ^459 Appointments at the 20th Party Congress that do not conform to these trends would be particularly notable. In particular, younger leaders \"helicoptered\" to the Politburo Standing Committee without first serving on the Politburo are relatively likely to be targeted for serving in a top leadership position in the future. For example, Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping, and Li Keqiang were all elevated from the Central Committee to the Politburo Standing Committee in this way in 1992 and 2007.^460\n---\n\n **Finished.**"}]}

In the late 1970s, during the transition away from Maoism, the CCP authorized the State Council to manage day-to-day administration of the country. Alex He, \"The Emerging Model of Economic Policy Making under Xi Jinping: China's Political Structure and Decision-making Process,\" Centre for International Governance Innovation, December 2018, 11; Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, \"China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress,\" Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 27. \u2020 The State Planning Commission was first established in 1952 and charged with managing the central planned economy. In 1998, it was renamed the State Development Planning Commission, which in 2003 merged with the State Council Office for Restructuring the Economic System and part of the State Economic and Trade Commission to form the National Development and Reform Commission. Peter Martin, \"The Humbling of the NDRC: China's National Development and Reform Commission Searches for a New Role Amid Restructuring,\" China Brief, March 6, 2014. \u2021 When Xi came to power in 2012, the National Development and Reform Commission was also \"one of the first major bureaucracies to fall under Xi's anticorruption radar. Dozens of [National Development and Reform Commission] officials were netted, including Deputy Director Liu Tienan, who managed the energy portfolio.\" Neil Thomas, \"Change of Plans: Making Market Capitalism Safe for China,\" MacroPolo, December 30, 2018.\n---\n50 ## Increasing Supervision and Control of Local Experimentation beyond the 20th Party Congress Despite Xi's centralization drive, economic policy implementation of top-level directives retains decentralized features. The reasons for this are structural, pragmatic, and strategic. Structurally, given China's geographic and population size, central leaders have little choice but to rely on local-level implementation of their plans. Pragmatically, central leaders continue to derive utility from local governments and officials figuring out what high-level directives such as \"supply-side structural reform\" should mean in practice. By passing responsibility to local levels, the central government puts the onus of resource expenditure on them while preserving its own resources. Further, the center can actively promote the specific implementation solutions that work well at the local level. Strategically, the central government is able to shift blame onto local governments whenever anything goes wrong. As Ran Ran and Yan Jian, scholars of Chinese politics, explain, \"Upper level Chinese officials are inclined to deflect the blame downward to those at the lower levels who are in a less powerful position in the administrative system.\"\u00b9\u2076\u2070 All of these factors enable Xi to take credit when things go right, blame others when things go wrong, and allow those below him to do the difficult work of trying to implement vague and contradictory top-level guidance. Dr. Teets emphasized in testimony before the Commission, however, that policy experimentation in the Xi era is increasingly \"supervised,\" with digital governance tools augmenting the center's ability to \"directly monitor local compliance.\"\u00b9\u2076\u00b9 This has led the governance structure to become \"less fragmented between Party and State, and between the central and local levels of government, removing much of the previous policy discretion in the system.\"\u00b9\u2076\u00b2 While reduced local discretion has benefits related to better implementation, less corruption, and more mobilization and standardization capacity, Xi's changes to governance have also led to confusion and frustration among cadres who face less clarity on promotion prospects, a sense of paralysis, and decreasing morale.\u00b9\u2076\u00b3 Centralization and bureaucratization remain ongoing processes and are far from complete, but the shift to this style of governance will increasingly endure \"the same problems that all rigid bureaucracies do: less innovation to solve local problems, inadequacy of \"one-size-fits-all policies,\" challenges of collecting enough information, and of regulating elite ambition within the system.\"\u00b9\u2076\u2074 Nonetheless, Dr. Teets assesses that through the 20th Party Congress and beyond, \"Xi Jinping's belief that the Party-state system was facing existential threats under the previous system makes any deviation from political centralization unlikely.\"*\u00b9\u2076\u2075 *Optimistically, Dr. Teets forecasts that as \"power accrues to the Party leadership and former veto players are pushed out of the system, we will observe policy reform in traditionally challenging areas, such as the urbanization-household registration nexus, advanced economic reform, and land reform. In the past, these reforms were not feasible because local or factional leaders opposed them, but now these changes may be made.\" Jessica Teets, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 4.\n---\n51 # Placing, Promoting, and Rewarding Personnel in the Economic Domain: Xi's Network of Loyalists Building and placing networks of loyalists in key domains is one of the most important aspects of control in the CCP's Leninist system. In the sprawling economic domain in particular, wherein numerous technical issue areas make it impossible for one individual to track everything at the center let alone at the localities, Xi relies on a coterie of loyalists to carry out his will. Xi leans heavily on the CCP's Central Organization Department, a powerful Party organ that directly monitors, evaluates, and controls promotions for thousands of positions throughout the Party system, thus making it an immensely important institution to Xi's plans for economic grand steerage as well for the millions of cadres seeking promotion into positions of prominence.* The Organization Department's influence has only increased since 2018, when the State Administration of Civil Service, which formerly handled the appointment and assignment of state officials, was abolished and its functions absorbed into the Organization Department.\u00b9\u2076\u2076 Xi has filled the Organization Department's leadership role, effectively his \"chief personnel officer,\" with close associate Chen Xi, who was his roommate and close friend as a fellow \"worker-peasant-soldier student\" at Tsinghua University, when they both studied the same subject (chemical engineering) at the same time (1975\u20131979).\u00b9\u2076\u2077 Control over the Organization Department allows Xi not only to promote loyalists to any position within the \"leading cadre system,\" including the heads of the provincial organization departments, but also to embed his preferred economic promotion metrics into the evaluation criteria leading cadres compete to meet, mobilizing China's personnel apparatus to further his own politically informed economic development agenda.\u00b9\u2076\u2078 Xi's loyalists are also perched atop the key \"comprehensive\" economic decision units, namely those that are more important than specific functional bureaucracies. Most important in this regard is Liu He, who handles the relevant economic issues at both the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission. Liu, as with Chen Xi, is a close associate from Xi's youth.\u00b9\u2076\u2079 In the state bureaucracy, Xi also placed He Lifeng, one of his closest associates dating back to their time in Fujian in the 1980s, at the head of the National Development and Reform Commission.\u00b9\u2077\u2070 He could become Xi's top economic advisor, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal, taking over for Liu and overseeing day-to-day economic work at the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission.\u00b9\u2077\u00b9 Liu is over the implicit retirement age and, if the implicit norm holds, would vacate these positions at the 20th Party Congress.\u00b9\u2077\u00b2 *The leading cadre system is estimated to contain over two million positions, with roughly 2,500 at the provincial/ministerial level. Cadre evaluation has also become substantially more centralized over time, with the Organization Department promulgating a variety of more specific metrics, the provinces more closely monitoring the counties, and the center more closely monitoring the provinces for compliance.

Christopher Carothers, postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for the Study of Contemporary China and an expert on Xi's anticorruption campaign, has documented the rise of inspections and their transition from \"corruption control to everything control.\" 173 Dr. Carothers argues that the \"Xi administration initially strengthened inspections to combat corruption but then repurposed them to serve as a top-down governance mechanism in numerous other areas as well,\" including implementation of Xi's economic development initiatives. 174 Investigations and inspections have become tools to coerce a geographically and functionally fragmented and decentralized bureaucracy and group of local elites into compliance with top-down economic decisions. 175 Dr. Carothers notes that these visits \"produce a great deal of fear among bureaucrats and businesspeople,\" as inspectors' determinations, which are increasingly focused on substantively monitoring policy implementation, can have \"swift and dramatic consequences.\" 176 As in other domains, Xi relies in particular on the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and the National Supervisory Commission\u2014both of which are headed by Xi loyalists\u2014to enforce implementation of central economic decisions.* 177 Xi's much-touted campaign to eliminate absolute poverty\u2020 in China is a prominent example of the involvement of these commissions in disciplining lower-level decision-makers and implementers. The National Supervisory Commission and CCDI worked at Xi's personal instruction to pressure and closely monitor Party and government officials to enact his campaign-style poverty reduction efforts, investigating and disciplining more than 99,000 people in 2019 for corruption related to poverty alleviation efforts. 178 More recently, investigations have been ongoing into leaders in areas related to China's flagging technological upgrading ambitions. Xiao Yaqing, responsible for overseeing industrial policy initiatives in semiconductors and other high-technology areas as the Minister of Industry and Information Technology, was removed from his post as minister in July 2022 and placed under investigation for a \"violation of discipline and law,\" making him the highest-ranking official ensnared ---- *The head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Zhao Leji, is considered one of Xi's two closest allies on the Politburo Standing Committee. The head of the National Supervisory Commission, Yang Xiaodu, served with Xi in Shanghai and was a deputy of Wang Qishan for several years prior to his appointment in March 2018.

At the 20th Party Congress, the selection of any individual aged 68 or above to serve on the Politburo or Politburo Standing Committee likely indicates a particular interest in to remain China's top leader beyond the 21st Party Congress in 2027. Conversely, even if Xi does plan to step down in 2027, he may still refrain from publicly anointing a successor if he has concerns that doing so could provide a platform for that individual to challenge him prematurely. A decision to appoint a successor or successors could be a sign that Xi feels pressure from other leaders to identify an end date to his rule, or it could indicate he is confident enough in his political control that the identification of an eventual successor does not threaten his position in the interim. ^* No woman has ever served on the Politburo Standing Committee. There are also very few recent historical cases of uniformed military officers in the Politburo moving up to the Politburo Standing Committee level.

Similarly, a lowering of the retirement age may suggest a desire by the top leader to prevent the advancement of one or more individuals within the age band disqualified by the change. - Party Charter: In the past, the CCP has used the occasion of the Party Congress to add references to the top leaders' personal contributions to Party doctrine into the CCP Charter.* 464 Xi's signature contribution, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and BRI were included in the Party charter at the 19th Party Congress in 2017.465 Any additional changes that highlight the status of Xi's contributions would signal a further elevation of his personal status in the Party.466 - Speeches and Reports: The CCP's political work report\u2020 is an extremely important indicator of the new leadership's policy priorities that sets the tone for the next five years.467 After the conclusion of the Party Congress, speeches and public statements by newly selected CCP leaders are also important to observe. In the event Xi retains his leadership of the Party, the level of emphasis his major initiatives and policy slogans receive in these high-level statements will provide clues about his political standing and intentions following the Party Congress. ---- *Similar adjustments to the text of the PRC Constitution are generally made at the National People's Congress the following spring. \u2020The political work report summarizes the accomplishments of the previous Central Committee leadership and is traditionally presented by the previous general secretary at the opening of the Party Congress.

In January 2016, the PLA Discipline Inspection Com-\nmission, which had been housed in the General Political Department\nsince 1990, was returned to the CMC, giving the inspection organi-\nzation greater independence from the PLA bureaucracy.370 After this\nadjustment, CMC Vice Chairman Xu Qiliang reportedly encouraged\ndiscipline inspectors to \"take advantage of their new standing\" within\nthe PLA when investigating PLA officers' political loyalty, power, and\nresponsibility.371 In October 2017, the head of the newly relocated PLA\nDiscipline Inspection Commission was elevated to the rank of a CMC\nmember, further increasing the investigation organization's authority\nand acknowledging its heightened political significance.372 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making Xi has led a dramatic reorganization of the upper echelons of\nPLA decision-making, but below the CMC, the basic mechanisms\nfor Party control of the military\u2014political officers, and Party\ncommittees\u2014have not changed significantly. Instead of reforming\nlower Party structures, Xi is reinvigorating political work within *Mr. Lee assesses that Xi likely delegates some responsibility for such promotional decisions to\nthe director of the CMC Political Work Department, Miao Hua. Roderick Lee, written testimony\nfor U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and\nthe 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 9.\n---\n76 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making\u2014Continued these structures and pressing political officers to focus on learning military affairs to participate more in military decision-making and make political work more relevant to success in war. ### Dual Command and the Political Officer:\nThroughout the PLA, from company to theater command, the PLA continues its longstanding practice known as the \"military and political dual-leadership system.\" 374 Under this system, every unit has two principal officers, a commander and a political officer, who serve as co-equals and share joint responsibility for issuing orders and overseeing daily tasks.375 The roles are designed to be complementary, with the commander responsible for military decisions and the political officer responsible for political and personnel decisions.376 The political officer's functions combine activities similar to a chaplain, sergeant major, inspector general, judge advocate, human resources officer, social worker, and Party whip. His areas of responsibility range from ideological discipline to political and moral education, military law, soldier wellbeing, and professional development.377 ### Party Committees:\nLike the rest of society under CCP rule, the PLA also has Party organizations embedded in each military unit and major staff organization.* 378 \"This Party committee structure creates a 'trusted agent' in the aggregate,\" explains Mr. Lee. 379 \"Instead of having a single individual whom Xi trusts, a collective group of individuals who are promoted based on both political and military affairs traits are responsible for unit control and oversight.\" 380 The political officer and unit commander usually serve as the secretary and deputy secretary of their unit's Party committee.381 ### Steady State vs. Wartime Decision-Making:\nIn steady state, commanders direct day-to-day military activities while political officers ensure these operations are conducted in line with political goals.382 In transition to crisis or wartime, Mr. Lee explains, \"most of a Party committee's functions are relatively 'high-level' in nature and do not involve the Party committee needing to approve every action made within a unit.\" 383 They do, however, have the authority to review in committee any decision an individual leader, such as the commander or political officer, makes on the spot.384 ### A House Divided?\nA common PLA slogan, \"division of labor [does] not divide the house,\" reminds commanders and political officers they have different duties but must work together.385 In 2019, the PLA Daily reminded soldiers of the Gutian All-Military Political Work Conference that CMC Chairman Xi personal- *The term \"Party committee\" (\u515a\u59d4) is used for organizations that are established at the regiment level and above. At the battalion level and in second-level functional and administrative departments of the PLA, the relevant Party organ is called a \"grassroots Party committee\" (\u57fa\u5c42\u515a\u59d4). At the company level, they are referred to as \"Party branches\" (\u515a\u652f\u90e8). The term \"Party small group\" (\u515a\u5c0f\u7ec4) is used at the platoon level and for ad hoc organizations at any level that are created for a specific purpose and have three or more Party members. Kenneth W. Allen et al., \"Personnel of the People's Liberation Army,\" BluePath Labs (prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission), November 2022, 17.\n---\n77 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making\u2014Continued ly hosted five years earlier where he raised concerns that some political officers had become useless because they were afraid to speak their voice or insert their hand in military affairs.386 Xi exhorted political officers to get more involved in operations, training, and military command and control so that they could learn to make political work a greater part of military success in wartime. In late 2021, the Ministry of National Defense again raised Xi's exhortations at the Gutian conference, recommending \"Meritorious Li Yannian,\" a new television series about a Korean War political commissar who was an expert in both military and political affairs.387 Despite these continuing efforts, tensions remain that raise questions about the degree to which this political oversight will complicate or slow the PLA's military decision-making. As Mr. Lee cited in testimony to the Commission, a \"PLA Navy officer who attended the Rim of the Pacific exercise in 2016\" expressed clear frustration with political oversight on military affairs when he \"lamented that the PLA's 'nanny command style' was inadequate for modern operations.\"388 ## Control over China's Internal Security and the Political-Legal Apparatus Similar to his efforts to assert dominance over the PLA, Xi has made it a priority since the earliest days of his leadership to control China's domestic public security apparatus.389 In addition to the reforms to China's paramilitary forces detailed above, Xi has dedicated significant attention to reforming elements and overall control of China's political-legal system.390 The political-legal system is the bureaucracy responsible for law enforcement, public security, and domestic coercion in China, including the courts, procuratorates, MPS, Ministry of State Security,* Ministry of Justice, and police academies.\u2020391 Changes to the political-legal system under Xi have sought to ensure the strict, hierarchical Party control and political loyalty of the apparatus most directly linked to domestic regime security.392 ### Motivation for Enhanced Control over Political-Legal Work Xi perceives the domestic security apparatus as a foundational guarantor of the Party's control that must remain loyal in all circumstances.393 His focus on this area most likely reflects an under- *The MPS is responsible for domestic law enforcement in China, including riot control and the overall maintenance of \"social order.\" The Ministry of State Security is China's main civilian intelligence and counterintelligence agency whose missions include protecting China's national security writ large, securing political and social stability, conducting counterintelligence, and implementing security-related laws. Timothy Heath, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on What Keeps Xi Up at Night: Beijing's Internal and External Challenges, February 7, 2019, 8\u20139. \u2020The Chinese Communist Party Regulations on the Political Legal Work issued in January 2019 define \"political-legal units\" as \"specialized forces engaged in political-legal work under the leadership of the Party, primarily including judicial organs, procuratorial organs, public security organs, national security organs, judicial administrative organs, and other units.\" Xinhua, \"CCP Central Committee Publishes \"Chinese Communist Party Regulations on Political-Legal Work\" (\u4e2d\u5171\u4e2d\u592e\u5370\u53d1\u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u653f\u6cd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6761\u4f8b\u300b), January 18, 2019. Translation.\n---\n78 standing of the political-legal system as a necessary tool and weap-\non of the Party and top Party leadership.394 CCP sources commonly\nrefer to the public security apparatus as \"the knife,\" and Xi has\nidentified that a foundational principle of political-legal work must\nbe \"ensur[ing] that the handle of the knife is firmly grasped in the\nhand of the Party and the people.\"395 Regulations on political-legal\nwork issued under Xi's tenure also make clear that political-legal\nwork is an important channel for the Party's leadership of so-called\n\"dictatorial functions,\"* in other words, the coercive aspects of do-\nmestic governance.396 This domestic monitoring and enforcement\ncapability, while theoretically targeted at enemies of the Party-state,\ncan nonetheless be turned even upon the CCP leadership itself.397\nWithout firm control over this lever of power, Xi would be unable\nto secure his desired leadership for the Party or for himself in any\nother policy area. Nevertheless, upon his rise to power Xi perceived that the han-\ndle of the knife had slipped dangerously out of the control of the\nCCP top leadership.398 Under Hu Jintao, the public security appa-\nratus had enjoyed a significant level of autonomy and policy influ-\nence vis-\u00e0-vis the CCP top leadership in a manner similar to the\nmilitary.399 Then Politburo Standing Committee member and head\nof the Party's Central Political-Legal Affairs Commission (CPLAC)\nZhou Yongkang, for example, possessed a firm grip over the regime's\nintelligence and security bureaucracy and became a cautionary tale\nof the dangers of such independent power.400 Zhou was suspected\nof not only corruption but also conspiring with Bo Xilai against the\ncentral Party leadership and attempting to contravene a Politbu-\nro Standing Committee consensus to purge the disgraced leader.401\nCorruption and clientelism were also areas of concern.402 According\nto analysis by Christopher Johnson, senior fellow at the Center for\nStrategic and International Studies, published in conjunction with\nthe Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin, Xi perceived that\nlax leadership by his predecessor had allowed the domestic security\napparatus so much leeway as to pose a threat to the cohesion of the\nParty system itself.\u2020 403\n---\n\nChunk 1\nSource: CCP_Decision_Making_Xi_Chapter1_Feb2025.md\n---\nXi has embedded a broad definition of \"national security\" into decision-making in nearly every policy area (see \"Xi's 'Comprehensive National Security Concept'\" below), which complements his emphasis on coordinated, centralized leadership.^103 Since 2014, the CCP claims to have made \"security development a common thread in every domain of national development,\" and the majority of Party and state organs now directly support some aspect of China's so-called \"national security work.\"^104 As Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at RAND Corporation, explained in 2015, the adjustment means \"anything [CCP] authorities deem an impediment to the realization of any of the country's developmental objectives\u2014regardless of whether it is economic, political or another category\u2014may now be deemed a 'security threat.'\"^105 ---- *While only one of the Two Safeguards mentions Xi by name, both of the Two Establishes concern him directly.

Translation.\n---\n41 ## Xi's \"Comprehensive National Security Concept\" Xi has introduced a so-called \"Comprehensive National Security Concept\"* that argues that threats to the CCP regime may originate from any field in the domestic or international arena and that these threats require coordinated, proactive efforts to manage. Its introduction in 2014 heralded a dramatic broadening and elevation of the concept of national security within China's policy framework.106 As Sheena Chestnut Greitens, associate professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, testified before the Commission, the concept is primarily concerned with threats to the security of the CCP regime and political system.107 According to official descriptions, it covers a wide and expanding range of policy areas within the definition of national security.108 To date, this includes at least political security, military security, territorial security, economic security, cultural security, societal security, scientific security, internet security, environmental security, resource security, nuclear security, security of overseas interests, space security, deep sea security, polar security, and biological security.\u2020 109 The concept considers both internal and external threats in each of these areas as well as the potential for the two types of threats to interact with and exacerbate one another.110 It further emphasizes the importance of proactive efforts to neutralize threats before they cause lasting damage.111 To better coordinate the expansion of security responsibilities throughout the bureaucracy, Xi has strengthened central control by creating the Central National Security Commission (CNSC) and its associated hierarchy.112 Xi presided over the creation of the CNSC in 2014 by elevating the previously ad hoc Central National Security Leading Small Group to the status of a permanent commission, thereby granting it a permanent staff office, a regular membership, and a position of greater influence within the bureaucracy.113 Since 2014, the CNSC has served as the CCP Central Committee's official \"coordinating mechanism for decision-making and discussion\" on the broad range of issues now deemed \"national security\" affairs and the institutional manifestation of Xi's Comprehensive National Security Concept.114 It functions as the highest decision-making body for integrated national security issues, merging the bureaucratic stove- *The term is also sometimes translated \"overall national security concept\" or \"holistic national security concept.\" Manoj Kewalramani, \"Xi's Boao Forum Speech - 20th Party Congress Nominations - State Council on Agriculture & Energy Security - Xinjiang Secretary Ma Xingrui on National Security - Wang Yi's South Caucasus Diplomacy,\" Tracking People's Daily, April 21, 2022; Joel Wuthnow, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 2; Sheena Chestnut Greitens, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on U.S.-China Relations at the Chinese Communist Party's Centennial, January 28, 2021, 1. \u2020Party sources often describe the relationship between various areas as: \"the security of the people as the aim; political security as the fundamental principle; economic security as the foundation; military, cultural, and societal security as guarantees; and the promotion of international security as the source of support.\" Tang Aijun, \"Ideological Security in the Framework of the Overall National Security Outlook\" (\u603b\u4f53\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u89c2\u89c6\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5b89\u5168), Socialism Studies, December 12, 2019.

Consequences arising from this recentralization include: - Centralized decision-making encourages further reliance on\ncampaign-style governance, which is ill-suited to addressing lon-\nger-term, structural challenges: As a Leninist party, the CCP is\ninherently mobilizational and often formulates and implements\npolicy in a campaign-style manner.120 Campaigns are appealing\nbecause in demanding rapid and clear results, they can over-\ncome bureaucracy and give the impression of responsiveness to\npolicy problems.121 By increasing the system's responsiveness to\ncentralized directives, Xi's streamlining of the system increases\nthe attractiveness of the mobilizational approach to policy for-\nmulation. Mr. Thomas testified that a mobilizational approach\ncan yield results in policy areas with short-term, measurable,\nand easily defined goals, such as the improvement of air quality\nin China's industrial northeast.122 Campaign-style governance\nis less effective in resolving longer-term structural challenges\nsuch as China's economic slowdown, declining productivity, and\nhigh debt levels, which require careful balancing between dif- *The group's broad membership reflects the requirements of the comprehensive national secu-\nrity concept's expansive and integrated nature.

In the late 1970s, during the transition away from Maoism, the CCP authorized the State Council to manage day-to-day administration of the country. Alex He, \"The Emerging Model of Economic Policy Making under Xi Jinping: China's Political Structure and Decision-making Process,\" Centre for International Governance Innovation, December 2018, 11; Susan Lawrence and Mari Lee, \"China's Political System in Charts: A Snapshot before the 20th Party Congress,\" Congressional Research Service, November 24, 2021, 27. \u2020 The State Planning Commission was first established in 1952 and charged with managing the central planned economy. In 1998, it was renamed the State Development Planning Commission, which in 2003 merged with the State Council Office for Restructuring the Economic System and part of the State Economic and Trade Commission to form the National Development and Reform Commission. Peter Martin, \"The Humbling of the NDRC: China's National Development and Reform Commission Searches for a New Role Amid Restructuring,\" China Brief, March 6, 2014. \u2021 When Xi came to power in 2012, the National Development and Reform Commission was also \"one of the first major bureaucracies to fall under Xi's anticorruption radar. Dozens of [National Development and Reform Commission] officials were netted, including Deputy Director Liu Tienan, who managed the energy portfolio.\" Neil Thomas, \"Change of Plans: Making Market Capitalism Safe for China,\" MacroPolo, December 30, 2018.\n---\n50 ## Increasing Supervision and Control of Local Experimentation beyond the 20th Party Congress Despite Xi's centralization drive, economic policy implementation of top-level directives retains decentralized features. The reasons for this are structural, pragmatic, and strategic. Structurally, given China's geographic and population size, central leaders have little choice but to rely on local-level implementation of their plans. Pragmatically, central leaders continue to derive utility from local governments and officials figuring out what high-level directives such as \"supply-side structural reform\" should mean in practice. By passing responsibility to local levels, the central government puts the onus of resource expenditure on them while preserving its own resources. Further, the center can actively promote the specific implementation solutions that work well at the local level. Strategically, the central government is able to shift blame onto local governments whenever anything goes wrong. As Ran Ran and Yan Jian, scholars of Chinese politics, explain, \"Upper level Chinese officials are inclined to deflect the blame downward to those at the lower levels who are in a less powerful position in the administrative system.\"\u00b9\u2076\u2070 All of these factors enable Xi to take credit when things go right, blame others when things go wrong, and allow those below him to do the difficult work of trying to implement vague and contradictory top-level guidance. Dr. Teets emphasized in testimony before the Commission, however, that policy experimentation in the Xi era is increasingly \"supervised,\" with digital governance tools augmenting the center's ability to \"directly monitor local compliance.\"\u00b9\u2076\u00b9 This has led the governance structure to become \"less fragmented between Party and State, and between the central and local levels of government, removing much of the previous policy discretion in the system.\"\u00b9\u2076\u00b2 While reduced local discretion has benefits related to better implementation, less corruption, and more mobilization and standardization capacity, Xi's changes to governance have also led to confusion and frustration among cadres who face less clarity on promotion prospects, a sense of paralysis, and decreasing morale.\u00b9\u2076\u00b3 Centralization and bureaucratization remain ongoing processes and are far from complete, but the shift to this style of governance will increasingly endure \"the same problems that all rigid bureaucracies do: less innovation to solve local problems, inadequacy of \"one-size-fits-all policies,\" challenges of collecting enough information, and of regulating elite ambition within the system.\"\u00b9\u2076\u2074 Nonetheless, Dr. Teets assesses that through the 20th Party Congress and beyond, \"Xi Jinping's belief that the Party-state system was facing existential threats under the previous system makes any deviation from political centralization unlikely.\"*\u00b9\u2076\u2075 *Optimistically, Dr. Teets forecasts that as \"power accrues to the Party leadership and former veto players are pushed out of the system, we will observe policy reform in traditionally challenging areas, such as the urbanization-household registration nexus, advanced economic reform, and land reform. In the past, these reforms were not feasible because local or factional leaders opposed them, but now these changes may be made.\" Jessica Teets, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 4.\n---\n51 # Placing, Promoting, and Rewarding Personnel in the Economic Domain: Xi's Network of Loyalists Building and placing networks of loyalists in key domains is one of the most important aspects of control in the CCP's Leninist system. In the sprawling economic domain in particular, wherein numerous technical issue areas make it impossible for one individual to track everything at the center let alone at the localities, Xi relies on a coterie of loyalists to carry out his will. Xi leans heavily on the CCP's Central Organization Department, a powerful Party organ that directly monitors, evaluates, and controls promotions for thousands of positions throughout the Party system, thus making it an immensely important institution to Xi's plans for economic grand steerage as well for the millions of cadres seeking promotion into positions of prominence.* The Organization Department's influence has only increased since 2018, when the State Administration of Civil Service, which formerly handled the appointment and assignment of state officials, was abolished and its functions absorbed into the Organization Department.\u00b9\u2076\u2076 Xi has filled the Organization Department's leadership role, effectively his \"chief personnel officer,\" with close associate Chen Xi, who was his roommate and close friend as a fellow \"worker-peasant-soldier student\" at Tsinghua University, when they both studied the same subject (chemical engineering) at the same time (1975\u20131979).\u00b9\u2076\u2077 Control over the Organization Department allows Xi not only to promote loyalists to any position within the \"leading cadre system,\" including the heads of the provincial organization departments, but also to embed his preferred economic promotion metrics into the evaluation criteria leading cadres compete to meet, mobilizing China's personnel apparatus to further his own politically informed economic development agenda.\u00b9\u2076\u2078 Xi's loyalists are also perched atop the key \"comprehensive\" economic decision units, namely those that are more important than specific functional bureaucracies. Most important in this regard is Liu He, who handles the relevant economic issues at both the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission. Liu, as with Chen Xi, is a close associate from Xi's youth.\u00b9\u2076\u2079 In the state bureaucracy, Xi also placed He Lifeng, one of his closest associates dating back to their time in Fujian in the 1980s, at the head of the National Development and Reform Commission.\u00b9\u2077\u2070 He could become Xi's top economic advisor, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal, taking over for Liu and overseeing day-to-day economic work at the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission.\u00b9\u2077\u00b9 Liu is over the implicit retirement age and, if the implicit norm holds, would vacate these positions at the 20th Party Congress.\u00b9\u2077\u00b2 *The leading cadre system is estimated to contain over two million positions, with roughly 2,500 at the provincial/ministerial level. Cadre evaluation has also become substantially more centralized over time, with the Organization Department promulgating a variety of more specific metrics, the provinces more closely monitoring the counties, and the center more closely monitoring the provinces for compliance.

Christopher Carothers, postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for the Study of Contemporary China and an expert on Xi's anticorruption campaign, has documented the rise of inspections and their transition from \"corruption control to everything control.\" 173 Dr. Carothers argues that the \"Xi administration initially strengthened inspections to combat corruption but then repurposed them to serve as a top-down governance mechanism in numerous other areas as well,\" including implementation of Xi's economic development initiatives. 174 Investigations and inspections have become tools to coerce a geographically and functionally fragmented and decentralized bureaucracy and group of local elites into compliance with top-down economic decisions. 175 Dr. Carothers notes that these visits \"produce a great deal of fear among bureaucrats and businesspeople,\" as inspectors' determinations, which are increasingly focused on substantively monitoring policy implementation, can have \"swift and dramatic consequences.\" 176 As in other domains, Xi relies in particular on the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and the National Supervisory Commission\u2014both of which are headed by Xi loyalists\u2014to enforce implementation of central economic decisions.* 177 Xi's much-touted campaign to eliminate absolute poverty\u2020 in China is a prominent example of the involvement of these commissions in disciplining lower-level decision-makers and implementers. The National Supervisory Commission and CCDI worked at Xi's personal instruction to pressure and closely monitor Party and government officials to enact his campaign-style poverty reduction efforts, investigating and disciplining more than 99,000 people in 2019 for corruption related to poverty alleviation efforts. 178 More recently, investigations have been ongoing into leaders in areas related to China's flagging technological upgrading ambitions. Xiao Yaqing, responsible for overseeing industrial policy initiatives in semiconductors and other high-technology areas as the Minister of Industry and Information Technology, was removed from his post as minister in July 2022 and placed under investigation for a \"violation of discipline and law,\" making him the highest-ranking official ensnared ---- *The head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Zhao Leji, is considered one of Xi's two closest allies on the Politburo Standing Committee. The head of the National Supervisory Commission, Yang Xiaodu, served with Xi in Shanghai and was a deputy of Wang Qishan for several years prior to his appointment in March 2018.

At the 20th Party Congress, the selection of any individual aged 68 or above to serve on the Politburo or Politburo Standing Committee likely indicates a particular interest in to remain China's top leader beyond the 21st Party Congress in 2027. Conversely, even if Xi does plan to step down in 2027, he may still refrain from publicly anointing a successor if he has concerns that doing so could provide a platform for that individual to challenge him prematurely. A decision to appoint a successor or successors could be a sign that Xi feels pressure from other leaders to identify an end date to his rule, or it could indicate he is confident enough in his political control that the identification of an eventual successor does not threaten his position in the interim. ^* No woman has ever served on the Politburo Standing Committee. There are also very few recent historical cases of uniformed military officers in the Politburo moving up to the Politburo Standing Committee level.

Similarly, a lowering of the retirement age may suggest a desire by the top leader to prevent the advancement of one or more individuals within the age band disqualified by the change. - Party Charter: In the past, the CCP has used the occasion of the Party Congress to add references to the top leaders' personal contributions to Party doctrine into the CCP Charter.* 464 Xi's signature contribution, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and BRI were included in the Party charter at the 19th Party Congress in 2017.465 Any additional changes that highlight the status of Xi's contributions would signal a further elevation of his personal status in the Party.466 - Speeches and Reports: The CCP's political work report\u2020 is an extremely important indicator of the new leadership's policy priorities that sets the tone for the next five years.467 After the conclusion of the Party Congress, speeches and public statements by newly selected CCP leaders are also important to observe. In the event Xi retains his leadership of the Party, the level of emphasis his major initiatives and policy slogans receive in these high-level statements will provide clues about his political standing and intentions following the Party Congress. ---- *Similar adjustments to the text of the PRC Constitution are generally made at the National People's Congress the following spring. \u2020The political work report summarizes the accomplishments of the previous Central Committee leadership and is traditionally presented by the previous general secretary at the opening of the Party Congress. It informs resolutions passed at the Party Congress itself and acts as an indicator of future policy priorities.

While this exceeded the World Bank's extreme poverty threshold of $1.90 in 2011 dollars, economists have argued that the standard is nevertheless too low for a country with China's aggregate wealth.

In October 2021, the CCP Central Committee announced it would undertake a series of disciplinary inspections into China's financial regulators, state-owned banks, and major financial institutions, with a statement from the CCDI describing the inspections as part of an effort to \"strengthen the Party's leadership of financial work.\"181 The probe began as questions about China's high debt levels and inability to shift toward its \"high-quality\" growth model came into sharper relief for China's leaders: the 2021 CCDI investigation was notable for its inclusion of China's state-owned asset management companies, such as China Huarong.182 The firm's chairman, Lai Xiaomin, was executed following his conviction on bribery charges in January 2021.183 Lai's execution was followed by Huarong missing a deadline to release its 2020 Annual Report in April 2021, further rattling China's financial markets.*184 Asset management companies were not scrutinized in a prior round of CCDI inspections into China's financial sector in 2015.\u2020185 Hugely indebted property developer Evergrande's missed bond payments in September and October 2021 likely also animated Party concerns about ties between nonstate companies and state-owned lenders.\u2021186 *A host of other factors likely contributed to the Party's concerns about Huarong and its ability to dispose of nonperforming loans (NPLs). Huarong is one of the original four asset management companies established by the Chinese government in 1999 to take NPLs off the balance sheets of the country's state-owned banks amid the government's broader bailout of them at the time. Beginning in 2006, Huarong expanded into several other lines of noncore business, including banking, brokerage, and fund management services, as well as lending to property developers, thereby departing from its original mandate of helping state-owned banks dispose of NPLs and growing in systemic importance. Ling Huawei, \"Ling Huawei: Huarong Can't Be Treated Like a Normal Company in Bankruptcy Restructuring,\" Caixin, April 12, 2021. \u2020The CCDI previously investigated China's financial sector in 2015 in the wake of a stock market rout and as part of the CCP's broader anticorruption campaign. In that investigation, the CCDI dispatched 15 inspection teams across 21 financial institutions (compared to 15 inspection teams across 25 financial institutions in 2021). Analysts assess the 2015 investigation was politically motivated, targeting patronage networks linked to specific political figures as Xi moved to consolidate power. It also targeted specific forms of market malfeasance, with probes into CITIC Securities General Manager Cheng Boming for insider trading and top officials at the then China Banking Regulatory Commission for corruption.

Xi has warned China's leading officials that \"formalism and bureaucratism kill people!\"192 He has further denounced these two issues as existential threats to the Party, describing them as the most hated aspects and a core reason for the fall of the Soviet Union.193 In contrast to Western critiques of \"bureaucracy\" that focused on structural issues, the CCP has routinely treated \"bureaucratism\" as stemming from wrong thought, moral failings, and weak ideological commitment.194 As made clear in an edited volume of Xi's speeches against formalism and bureaucratism that cadres were made to study in 2020, formalism and bureaucratism result from an improper worldview and ideology as well as lack of \"faith\" and weak \"ideals and convictions.\"195 Unlike Mao, who during the Cultural Revolution incited ideological fervor among the masses to attack Party and government structures and officials, Xi is seeking to use ideology to energize Party and government officials to faithfully and vigorously carry out his top-level guidance and engage in a permanent \"self-revolution\" to internalize his sanctioned approach to thinking, behaving, and ultimately making decisions.*196 Ideologically molding official decision-making is a crucial cornerstone of Xi's approach to furthering his economic agenda, going well beyond simple reward and punishment and venturing into deeper 20, 2021, 8\u201312.\n*\"Self-revolution\" is a common theme in Xi's speeches. In context, it refers to a process of self-evaluation and self-criticism, geared especially toward inducing the individual to be a better cadre who pursues a disciplined life and thoroughly imbibes the thought and policy preferences of Xi.\n---\n55 aspects of thought control.* The inculcation of what is termed Xi Jinping's Economic Thought has only grown more intensive in the runup to the 20th Party Congress. In June 2022, the Central Propaganda Department\u2020 and the National Development and Reform Commission jointly organized and published a new book, the Outline for Studying Xi Jinping's Economic Thought, which was immediately made mandatory reading for all Party organizations at all levels.197 In studying, cadres were told to \"arm their minds with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\" so as to \"guide practice, promote work, and more consciously use Xi Jinping's economic thought to guide and solve practical problems,\" particularly in areas related to Xi's \"new development philosophy.\"\u2021 198 In effect, Xi wants CCP cadres, particularly those in the most important economic decision-making positions, to internalize his top-level economic development priorities and reflexively produce economic decisions that align with those priorities.\u00a7 Correct thought, in Xi's view, translates into correct action, allowing \"the majority of Party members and the masses to feel the formidable power of ideals and beliefs by means of practical actions.\"\u00b6 199 David Ownby and Timothy Cheek, China scholars with expertise in political ideology and governance, call Xi's efforts a \"revival of governing by ideology\" and consider them a direct response \"to the increasing social and intellectual pluralism that China's economic development and engagement with the world have produced.\"200 Governing by Ideology: Zero-COVID Campaign Puts\nPolitical Ideology over Economic Growth China's strict adherence to the Zero-COVID policy in 2022 demonstrates the extent to which top-down centralized management has displaced local discretion under Xi.

Because the CMC chairman is the only individual to sit on both the Politburo Standing Committee and the CMC, the position gives Xi sole responsibility for coordination between the two most powerful bodies in the Party.335 Xi has also worked to strengthen the position's authority by placing a renewed emphasis on the \"Chairman Responsibility System,\" a stipulation in the 1982 PRC Constitution that grants ultimate authority for military affairs to the CMC chairman.336 Under Xi's predecessors Jiang and Hu, the CMC's two uniformed vice chairmen took responsibility for the majority of CMC decision-making on the chairman's behalf in a pattern that became known as the \"Vice Chairman Responsibility System.\"337 Xi identified this arrangement as a major contributor to a trend of excessive PLA autonomy and has done away with it in favor of concentrating power in his own hands.338 A 2017 amendment to the PRC Constitution and a 2020 military regulation on political work cemented this status by giving Xi final say in all CMC work and the ability to set the military's agenda on all political and operational issues.*339 According to Mr. Lee's assessment in his testimony for the Commission, the anecdotal evidence available by cataloguing Xi's military meeting agenda since becoming CMC chairman in 2012 suggests he is particularly involved in decision-making on defining PLA reform milestones and objectives, transforming the Southern Theater Command into a modern joint operations command organization, and modernizing the PLA Army and Navy.340 ## Personal Ideological Promotion Xi has also elevated his position by using official speeches, publications, and Party media to paint himself as a great military strategist to whom the armed forces owe complete personal loyalty. Shortly after Xi came to power, a series of high-ranking senior PLA officers made public declarations of loyalty to him, with their statements receiving an unusual level of coverage in Party media.341 Beginning in 2016, official sources began using the title \"Commander in Chief\" in a push to paint Xi as a leader who understands and commands respect from the military, on some occasions even showing him wearing a military uniform while sitting upon a throne-like commander's chair.342 Xi has promulgated a military component of his personal ideology, so-called \"Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military,\" and his treatises are required reading for soldiers.343 State media encourage the armed forces to not only study and implement *In 2017, the PRC Constitution was amended to stipulate that the CMC chairman \"assumes overall responsibility over the work of the [CMC],\" indicating that Xi's voice almost certainly has the final say among the seven members of the CMC. Regulations on Party building in the armed forces promulgated in 2020 further stipulate that the CMC chairman must lead and command the national armed forces and determine all major issues of national defense and military building. This description reveals that the role of CMC chairman officially includes both political leadership and command authority over the armed forces.

If this problem had not been completely solved, it would not only have diminished the military's combat capacity, but also undermined the key political principle that the Party commands the gun.353 Increased emphasis on political work in the military and paramilitary under Xi's leadership has thus focused on ensuring that the armed forces' loyalty is to the Party and the Party alone.354 In emphasizing the danger of the Party losing its leadership role and control over the PLA, Xi has in part sought to combat discourse on the idea of \"nationalization\" of the PLA as a national army of the PRC rather than a Party army.355 Under Xi's predecessors, nationalization of the PLA had become a topic of discussion in some PLA circles, which Xi has openly sought to rectify.356 China's military leadership does not perceive a tradeoff between the political reliability and operational capability of its officers.357 Instead of officers being designated either \"red\" or \"expert,\" according to Mr. Lee's testimony before the Commission, \"operational proficiency and political awareness are increasingly intermingled the more senior one becomes,\" the ideal being to embody what CCP propaganda terms a \"double expert.\"358 According to testimony by James Mulvenon, former director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis at SOS International, personnel choices in the PLA are increasingly \"political choices between professional officers.\"359 In other words, he argues, political criteria are employed to choose among two or more fully qualified professional officers.360 As the military capability and professionalism of the entire PLA have risen, the system has not resulted in widespread promotion of politically reliable people at the expense of professional military competence, as is sometimes supposed.361 ## Personnel Decisions According to the PRC's Active Military Officer Service Law, the CMC chairman officially appoints and removes all active-duty offi- of Party affairs positions in the PLA, including as political commissar and Party committee secretary of a reserve unit, in a military garrison, in a military subdistrict at the municipal level, and at the provincial military district level. Finally, in a rare appointment of a civilian senior Party cadre to the powerful position of CMC vice chairman, Xi served for two years on the CMC prior to his appointment to general secretary of the Party and CMC chairman in 2012.

The\neconomic domain is unique, however, in the degree to which decen-\ntralization and devolution of economic decisions had become core\nfeatures of China's economy prior to Xi's ascension. In contrast to\nspeculation at the beginning of his term that Xi might accentuate\nthese trends as a market-oriented reformer, he has rather proven\nto be a reformer of a very different kind: a Leninist aiming to re-\nvive the Party's ability to more assertively penetrate and steer the\neconomy, enact control over economic agents, and neutralize coun-\ntervailing centers of economic power.\u2020 128 Centralized economic deci-\nsion-making under Xi aims to steer China's economy toward a new\n\"high-quality\" growth model, aiming to not only entrench and legiti-\nmize the CCP's position at home in the process but also buttress its *Strict pollution standards, for example, might lead wealthier provinces to invest in clean en-\nergy technologies and poorer provinces to pare back pollutive manufacturing activity. Guangdong,\na wealthy province along China's eastern seaboard, for example, pledged in its provincial 14th\nFive-Year Plan to \"implement renewable energy replacement [of fossil energy],\" invoking Xi's call\nfrom March 2021 to \"establish a new type of power system with new energy as the mainstay.\"\n\"New energy\" in CCP policy pronouncement often refers to recently developed energy generation\ntechnologies such as wind and solar power as opposed to traditional fossil or hydrogeneration\ntechnologies.

Adopted\noriginally from the Soviet Union, Leninism calls for a \"vanguard\" party organized along strict hi-\nerarchical lines not only to firmly dominate and control the government but also to penetrate and\ncontrol society more broadly. For more, see Joseph Fewsmith, written testimony for the U.S.-Chi-\nna Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th\nParty Congress, January 27, 2022, 1; Neil Harding, \"Leninism,\" Duke University Press, 1996.\n---\n44 influence globally.* 129 To accomplish this, Xi is reviving, enhancing, and building new levers of central control over China's sprawling economy. ## The Fragmentation of Economic Decision-Making Prior to the Xi Era In the decades preceding Xi, decentralization and devolution of economic decision-making came to characterize China's political economy. \"Fragmented authoritarianism\" became a widely used term to describe the sprawling nature of China's economic bureaucracy, which consists of two vertical hierarchies, the Party (e.g., Party committees) and the state (e.g., ministries), intermeshed with territorial-level governments (e.g., mayors) and replicated at five levels: central, provincial, county, city, and township. Around the period of China's Reform and Opening, the prominence and discretion of local implementation increased sizably.\u2020 As Dr. Teets argued in testimony before the Commission, the great strength of this model was the adaptability it afforded an otherwise rigid authoritarian state. Local governments were able to compete, innovate, and move quickly to encourage GDP growth.130 The problem CCP leaders perceived, however, was that their formal control over economic decision-making had eroded. Halting attempts to adjust the growth model under the Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao Administration highlighted conflicts between the central government, local governments, and emerging corporate class.131 Inability to push forward central directives also revealed the relative decline of Party control mechanisms as well as rampant corruption and state capture by networks of regime insiders.132 Vested interest groups across various sectors (e.g., real estate, infrastructure, finance, and energy) and geographic areas developed centers of power challenging Beijing. Characterized by informal patronage and loyalty networks, these blocs proved capable of influencing national politics and stymying central government initiatives in favor of parochial interests.\u2021 While this collusion between local governments and business may have fostered China's rapid growth, it undermined the effectiveness of central governance, often requiring Beijing to bargain informally with influential interest groups in exchange for compliance with top-level decisions.133 As vested interests undermined *As Neil Thomas explained in testimony before the Commission, \"For Xi, political power also has a policy purpose. Xi is not a simple megalomaniac. His personalist rule is an effort to 'concentrate power to do big things.'\" Neil Thomas, written testimony for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 4. \u2020Some analysts and scholars identify the centralization versus decentralization paradigm as the perpetual source of both development and conflict in authoritarian systems, as a \"continuous struggle\" and \"mutual interdependence\" of a \"despotic, universal state\" contends with \"a decentralized, particularistic aristocracy in actual possession of much of the power infrastructure of society.\" Mark Lupher, \"Power Restructuring in China and Russia,\" Westview Press, 1996, 10. As an example of this struggle within China, following the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, China was originally governed via six greater administrative areas, all headed by powerful revolutionaries. However, this system was abolished quickly in the 1950s in favor of smaller provincial governance units, as Mao feared that large local power bases were a mounting challenge to central authority. Xiao Ma, \"Localized Bargaining,\" Oxford University Press, 2022, 194. \u2021A recent insider-turned-defector's account of this process is captured in Desmond Shum's book Red Roulette, wherein the author demonstrates the informal networks of wealth and influence that proliferated in the Hu-Wen era involving intimate members of Premier Wen Jiabao's own family, high-ranking Party personnel, private businessmen, and a variety of other elites. In one chapter, Shum reveals that he, a non-Party member, was able to influence the promotion track of several cadres. Desmond Shum, Red Roulette, Simon & Schuster, September 7, 2021.\n---\n45 the Party internally, sources of wealth and influence outside the\nParty structure also rose precipitously, leading to the rapid relative\ndecline in importance of the Party's formal control mechanisms.134\nIncreasingly aware of their dwindling influence, CCP leaders came\nto view economic decentralization and fragmentation of authority as\na threat to their rule. Thus, while many within and outside China\nsaw liberalizing market-oriented reforms\u2014moves that would have\npromoted transparency, increased bottom-up input and accountability, and decreased the role of regime insiders over the economy\u2014as\nthe solution to increasingly obvious systemic defects, CCP leaders\nopted instead for top-down reform, revivifying the Party's influence\nover the economy. ## Power and Preservation Motivate Centralized Economic Decision-Making in the Xi Era General Secretary Xi came into power with a mandate to preserve and recentralize the Party's authority, increase compliance\nwith top-level economic directives throughout the Party-state bureaucracy, and crack down on vested interests.135 At the highest\nlevels, agreement was reached that reform from above via hierarchical, formal, Leninist Party structures was crucial to the Party's\npreservation. Xi's efforts are thus oriented around subjecting economic decision-makers to strict adherence to his \"top-level design\napproach.\"136 As Xi elaborated in a speech at the Fifth Plenum of\nthe 19th Central Committee in October 2020, his \"new development\ndynamic\" is intended to \"strengthen planning and design at the\ntop level, and delegate detailed tasks to lower levels with priorities\nassigned.\"137 Xi's approach is intended to counter the fragmented\nnature of the economic system that had arisen in the decades prior to his rule, in particular aiming to weaken centers of economic\ninfluence inside and outside the Party-state system that complicate\nor undermine his top-level direction. As Dr. Teets addressed in testimony before the Commission, this represents a decisive\u2014though\nas of yet incomplete\u2014move toward a new type of economic model\nwherein the center exerts greater control and the localities have\nfar less autonomy.138 Xi notes his intentions for consolidating and\ncentralizing in his Fifth Plenum speech, arguing that his \"new development dynamic must be built upon a unified national market,\nnot on small and fragmented local markets.\"139 In addition to Party preservation, Xi's drive to centralize control\nover the economy is motivated and justified in terms of engineering a comprehensive modernization drive to augment China's national power and global influence, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis the United\nStates.* 140 The Party's evolving economic development ambitions *In a speech given shortly after becoming general secretary in 2013, Xi outlined his guiding\nmotivation: \"we must concentrate our efforts on bettering our own affairs, continually broadening\nour comprehensive national power, improving the lives of our people, building a socialism that\nis superior to capitalism, and laying the foundation for a future where we will win the initiative\nand have the dominant position.\" In the third volume of Governance of China, Xi explains that a\n\"well-founded system is the biggest strength a country has, and competition in terms of systems\nis the most essential rivalry between countries.\" Beijing's nationalist pursuit of \"the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\" is routinely framed as part of this broad competition of systems,\nparticularly with the United States, and it is in turn used to justify the need for strengthening\nthe Party and enhancing its position over and within the economy. For more, see U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Chapter 1, Section 1, \"A Global Contest for Power and\nInfluence: China's Views of Strategic Competition with the United States,\" in 2020 Annual Report\n---\n46 are rhetorically and practically connected with the preservation of its domestic political position as well as its ability to exert global influence. Xi and his authorized propaganda regularly promote the idea that the Party is uniquely capable\u2014informed by allegedly scientific assessments stemming from its Marxist analytic framework\u2014of leading China and its economy to what he calls the \"great rejuvenation.\" 141 Barry Naughton, China economist at the University of California at San Diego, succinctly captures Beijing's evolving approach to its economy as a process of \"grand steerage.\" 142 At the 19th Party Congress, Xi introduced a new and expedited timetable for bolstering China's so-called \"comprehensive national power\" by way of having \"basically achieved modernization\" by 2035. 143 For Xi, achieving these expedited modernization goals simultaneously requires and justifies centralization, unity, and disciplined adherence to top-level economic directives. The CCP's preservation and reinvigoration is thus, at least in Xi's assessment, in a symbiotic relationship with his modernization goals and his ambitious vision for global leadership.\n---\n\nChunk 2\nSource: CCP_Decision_Making_Xi_Chapter1_Feb2025.md\n---\ncers at the division grade (typically senior colonels and major gener-\nals) and above.362 This authority means that as CMC chairman, Xi\nhas the sole authority to approve or disapprove all general and flag\nofficer promotions in the People's Armed Forces, a category Mr. Lee\nestimates has almost certainly numbered in the thousands since\nXi became CMC chairman.363 In his testimony, Mr. Lee noted that\nwhile it is unlikely Xi has involved himself in all of these promo-\ntions,* it is relatively safe to assume that since taking office he has\nhad a direct say in the promotion of at least all new full generals\nand admirals in the PLA.364 ## Anticorruption Campaigns Xi has used his anticorruption campaign both as a tool to at-\ntempt to address the corruption issue and as an implied threat to\nencourage compliance with his military reform agenda and personal\ncontrol.365 According to a compilation by the Center on U.S.-Chi-\nna Relations at the Asia Society, at least 62 PLA officers had been\nremoved for corruption by 2018, with 46 of those officers possess-\ning a rank of major general or above.366 The continuous threat of\ninvestigation is a potent tool to intimidate or remove officers who\nmight otherwise obstruct reform efforts or show insufficient loyalty\nto Xi.367 In his testimony before the Commission, Dr. Mulvenon sim-\nilarly argued that the ever-present threat of replacement via the an-\nticorruption campaign \"prevents the development of resistance and\nfactionalism within the PLA.\"368 In particular, he assessed that the\ncoercive threat of the anticorruption campaign was instrumental in\nallowing Xi to achieve such a dramatic reorganization of the PLA,\nwhich necessarily generated a lot of opposition from the losers of\nthe reform.369 Xi demonstrated the centrality of anticorruption to his vision of\nmilitary discipline by raising the bureaucratic status of the investiga-\ntion authority. In January 2016, the PLA Discipline Inspection Com-\nmission, which had been housed in the General Political Department\nsince 1990, was returned to the CMC, giving the inspection organi-\nzation greater independence from the PLA bureaucracy.370 After this\nadjustment, CMC Vice Chairman Xu Qiliang reportedly encouraged\ndiscipline inspectors to \"take advantage of their new standing\" within\nthe PLA when investigating PLA officers' political loyalty, power, and\nresponsibility.371 In October 2017, the head of the newly relocated PLA\nDiscipline Inspection Commission was elevated to the rank of a CMC\nmember, further increasing the investigation organization's authority\nand acknowledging its heightened political significance.372 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making Xi has led a dramatic reorganization of the upper echelons of\nPLA decision-making, but below the CMC, the basic mechanisms\nfor Party control of the military\u2014political officers, and Party\ncommittees\u2014have not changed significantly. Instead of reforming\nlower Party structures, Xi is reinvigorating political work within *Mr. Lee assesses that Xi likely delegates some responsibility for such promotional decisions to\nthe director of the CMC Political Work Department, Miao Hua. Roderick Lee, written testimony\nfor U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and\nthe 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 9.\n---\n76 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making\u2014Continued these structures and pressing political officers to focus on learning military affairs to participate more in military decision-making and make political work more relevant to success in war. ### Dual Command and the Political Officer:\nThroughout the PLA, from company to theater command, the PLA continues its longstanding practice known as the \"military and political dual-leadership system.\" 374 Under this system, every unit has two principal officers, a commander and a political officer, who serve as co-equals and share joint responsibility for issuing orders and overseeing daily tasks.375 The roles are designed to be complementary, with the commander responsible for military decisions and the political officer responsible for political and personnel decisions.376 The political officer's functions combine activities similar to a chaplain, sergeant major, inspector general, judge advocate, human resources officer, social worker, and Party whip. His areas of responsibility range from ideological discipline to political and moral education, military law, soldier wellbeing, and professional development.377 ### Party Committees:\nLike the rest of society under CCP rule, the PLA also has Party organizations embedded in each military unit and major staff organization.* 378 \"This Party committee structure creates a 'trusted agent' in the aggregate,\" explains Mr. Lee. 379 \"Instead of having a single individual whom Xi trusts, a collective group of individuals who are promoted based on both political and military affairs traits are responsible for unit control and oversight.\" 380 The political officer and unit commander usually serve as the secretary and deputy secretary of their unit's Party committee.381 ### Steady State vs. Wartime Decision-Making:\nIn steady state, commanders direct day-to-day military activities while political officers ensure these operations are conducted in line with political goals.382 In transition to crisis or wartime, Mr. Lee explains, \"most of a Party committee's functions are relatively 'high-level' in nature and do not involve the Party committee needing to approve every action made within a unit.\" 383 They do, however, have the authority to review in committee any decision an individual leader, such as the commander or political officer, makes on the spot.384 ### A House Divided?\nA common PLA slogan, \"division of labor [does] not divide the house,\" reminds commanders and political officers they have different duties but must work together.385 In 2019, the PLA Daily reminded soldiers of the Gutian All-Military Political Work Conference that CMC Chairman Xi personal- *The term \"Party committee\" (\u515a\u59d4) is used for organizations that are established at the regiment level and above. At the battalion level and in second-level functional and administrative departments of the PLA, the relevant Party organ is called a \"grassroots Party committee\" (\u57fa\u5c42\u515a\u59d4). At the company level, they are referred to as \"Party branches\" (\u515a\u652f\u90e8). The term \"Party small group\" (\u515a\u5c0f\u7ec4) is used at the platoon level and for ad hoc organizations at any level that are created for a specific purpose and have three or more Party members. Kenneth W. Allen et al., \"Personnel of the People's Liberation Army,\" BluePath Labs (prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission), November 2022, 17.\n---\n77 ## Party Control inside Military Decision-Making\u2014Continued ly hosted five years earlier where he raised concerns that some political officers had become useless because they were afraid to speak their voice or insert their hand in military affairs.386 Xi exhorted political officers to get more involved in operations, training, and military command and control so that they could learn to make political work a greater part of military success in wartime. In late 2021, the Ministry of National Defense again raised Xi's exhortations at the Gutian conference, recommending \"Meritorious Li Yannian,\" a new television series about a Korean War political commissar who was an expert in both military and political affairs.387 Despite these continuing efforts, tensions remain that raise questions about the degree to which this political oversight will complicate or slow the PLA's military decision-making. As Mr. Lee cited in testimony to the Commission, a \"PLA Navy officer who attended the Rim of the Pacific exercise in 2016\" expressed clear frustration with political oversight on military affairs when he \"lamented that the PLA's 'nanny command style' was inadequate for modern operations.\"388 ## Control over China's Internal Security and the Political-Legal Apparatus Similar to his efforts to assert dominance over the PLA, Xi has made it a priority since the earliest days of his leadership to control China's domestic public security apparatus.389 In addition to the reforms to China's paramilitary forces detailed above, Xi has dedicated significant attention to reforming elements and overall control of China's political-legal system.390 The political-legal system is the bureaucracy responsible for law enforcement, public security, and domestic coercion in China, including the courts, procuratorates, MPS, Ministry of State Security,* Ministry of Justice, and police academies.\u2020391 Changes to the political-legal system under Xi have sought to ensure the strict, hierarchical Party control and political loyalty of the apparatus most directly linked to domestic regime security.392 ### Motivation for Enhanced Control over Political-Legal Work Xi perceives the domestic security apparatus as a foundational guarantor of the Party's control that must remain loyal in all circumstances.393 His focus on this area most likely reflects an under- *The MPS is responsible for domestic law enforcement in China, including riot control and the overall maintenance of \"social order.\" The Ministry of State Security is China's main civilian intelligence and counterintelligence agency whose missions include protecting China's national security writ large, securing political and social stability, conducting counterintelligence, and implementing security-related laws. Timothy Heath, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on What Keeps Xi Up at Night: Beijing's Internal and External Challenges, February 7, 2019, 8\u20139. \u2020The Chinese Communist Party Regulations on the Political Legal Work issued in January 2019 define \"political-legal units\" as \"specialized forces engaged in political-legal work under the leadership of the Party, primarily including judicial organs, procuratorial organs, public security organs, national security organs, judicial administrative organs, and other units.\" Xinhua, \"CCP Central Committee Publishes \"Chinese Communist Party Regulations on Political-Legal Work\" (\u4e2d\u5171\u4e2d\u592e\u5370\u53d1\u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u653f\u6cd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6761\u4f8b\u300b), January 18, 2019. Translation.\n---\n78 standing of the political-legal system as a necessary tool and weap-\non of the Party and top Party leadership.394 CCP sources commonly\nrefer to the public security apparatus as \"the knife,\" and Xi has\nidentified that a foundational principle of political-legal work must\nbe \"ensur[ing] that the handle of the knife is firmly grasped in the\nhand of the Party and the people.\"395 Regulations on political-legal\nwork issued under Xi's tenure also make clear that political-legal\nwork is an important channel for the Party's leadership of so-called\n\"dictatorial functions,\"* in other words, the coercive aspects of do-\nmestic governance.396 This domestic monitoring and enforcement\ncapability, while theoretically targeted at enemies of the Party-state,\ncan nonetheless be turned even upon the CCP leadership itself.397\nWithout firm control over this lever of power, Xi would be unable\nto secure his desired leadership for the Party or for himself in any\nother policy area. Nevertheless, upon his rise to power Xi perceived that the han-\ndle of the knife had slipped dangerously out of the control of the\nCCP top leadership.398 Under Hu Jintao, the public security appa-\nratus had enjoyed a significant level of autonomy and policy influ-\nence vis-\u00e0-vis the CCP top leadership in a manner similar to the\nmilitary.399 Then Politburo Standing Committee member and head\nof the Party's Central Political-Legal Affairs Commission (CPLAC)\nZhou Yongkang, for example, possessed a firm grip over the regime's\nintelligence and security bureaucracy and became a cautionary tale\nof the dangers of such independent power.400 Zhou was suspected\nof not only corruption but also conspiring with Bo Xilai against the\ncentral Party leadership and attempting to contravene a Politbu-\nro Standing Committee consensus to purge the disgraced leader.401\nCorruption and clientelism were also areas of concern.402 According\nto analysis by Christopher Johnson, senior fellow at the Center for\nStrategic and International Studies, published in conjunction with\nthe Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin, Xi perceived that\nlax leadership by his predecessor had allowed the domestic security\napparatus so much leeway as to pose a threat to the cohesion of the\nParty system itself.\u2020 403\n---\n\n **Finished.**"}]}

The State Council shared\nauthority with the CMC over the funding and operation of the\nPeople's Armed Police (PAP, China's paramilitary force), which\nthen fell under the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and subdivisions of authority tied to the provinces.314 Local government\nand Party officials had some discretionary control over local PAP\nunits.315 Reports from the Hu era reveal that some local leaders had coopted the PAP to carry out extralegal tax collection,\ndebt recovery, land seizure, and even political violence, causing\nconcern that local leaders might also be able to use them to resist central authority.316 Local Party secretaries could also take\nadvantage of their leadership of local Party committees to direct\noperations by local PLA reserve units for personal gain.317 *The four general departments of the PLA included the General Staff Department, General\nPolitical Department, General Logistics Department, and General Armaments Department.

The CMC's role as the central institution responsible for making decisions about the use of China's armed forces has been greatly strengthened. This level of central control has come at the expense of previously autonomous PLA organizations, the State Council, and local officials of both the Party and the state. ## Broadening the CMC's Central Control Xi's military reforms overhauled the broad division of labor within the PLA such that the CMC provides overall management and direction, the theater commands focus on operations and warfighting, and the services are responsible for \"force-building,\" or what the U.S. military refers to as \"man, train, and equip\" responsibilities.* 318 A critical element of this effort involved disbanding the PLA's four powerful general departments into 15 less individually powerful organizations in 2016 and incorporating their responsibilities directly into a restructured CMC.\u2020 319 The change reduced the accumulated power of the PLA's \"General Headquarters\" (the four general departments, but primarily the General Staff Department) by placing its former functions such as training, mobilization, and strategic planning under direct CMC control with an eye toward improving information flows between the PLA and Party leadership.320 Xi's reforms also removed the heads of the individual services (PLA Army, Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force) from direct involvement in decision-making at the CMC level and assigned responsibility for directing warfighting to the newly formed theater commands, taking away two key functions from the service chiefs.321 Reforms to China's paramilitary forces, namely the PAP and Coast Guard, in 2017 and 2018 made them solely responsible to the CMC and clarified their identity as part of the broader armed forces.\u2021 Prior to Xi's reforms, the PAP operated under the dual leadership of both the CMC and the State Council.322 The State Council oversaw the PAP's operations, budget, size, and composition.323 On January 1, 2018, the CCP Central Committee discarded this dual-leadership system and granted the CMC full control ---- *For more on Xi's reforms to the CMC, see U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Chapter 2, Section 2, \"China's Military Reorganization and Modernization, Implications for the United States,\" in 2018 Annual Report to Congress, November 2018, 205\u2013258; and U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Chapter 2, Section 1, \"Year in Review: Security and Foreign Affairs,\" in 2016 Annual Report to Congress, November 2016, 193\u2013254. \u2020The CMC now has 15 major subordinate organizations, which replaced the previous four general departments as part of the ongoing PLA reforms in 2016. They include the General Office, Joint Staff Department, Political Work Department, Logistics Support Department, Equipment Development Department, Training Management Department, National Defense Mobilization Department, Discipline Inspection Commission, Political and Legal Affairs Commission, Science and Technology Commission, Strategic Planning Office, Reform and Organization Office, International Military Cooperation Office, Audit Bureau, and Organ Affairs General Management Bureau.

Prior to 2016, regional Party secretaries had frequently served as so-called \"first commissars\" of PLA reserve units within Provincial Military Districts, a designation that had allowed them to act as the first among equals over a reserve unit's military commander and political commissar.327 Roderick Lee, research director at the U.S. Air Force China Aerospace Studies Institute, assessed in his testimony to the Commission that this role granted local civilian leaders influence over the operations of local units and hence a level of power they could easily use for personal gain.328 After the reforms, local civilian authorities could no longer use PLA reserve units for local purposes without the relevant theater command assuming joint command over those forces.329 Similarly, prior to Xi's reforms, local Ministry of Public Security (MPS) officials held the designation of \"first commissar\" in local PAP detachments, affording them some discretionary control of those forces.330 As Joel Wuthnow, senior research fellow at the National Defense University Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs, testified before the Commission, in practice, local government and Party leaders occasionally summoned PAP units to stifle protests.331 Following the changes in 2017 and 2018, local officials must request authority from the center in order to deploy the PAP.332 ## Putting Xi at the Core of Armed Forces Decision-Making Decision-making over China's security forces is increasingly centered around Xi himself. His rise in power strengthened Party control over the armed forces, ensuring the implementation of military reforms that not only helped improve the PLA's operational capability but also further consolidated his political power in China.333 As a 2015 commentary in the PLA newspaper insisted, China's armed forces are responsible for \"resolutely responding to the call sent out by Chairman Xi, resolutely executing the requirements put forth by Chairman Xi, and resolutely completing the tasks bestowed upon them by Chairman Xi.\"334 *The Border Defense Force and Guards Force were both absorbed by the MPS. The Firefighting Force and the Forestry Force (responsible for fighting forest fires) were transferred to the State Council Emergency Management Department. The Gold Force (responsible for securing gold and other resources) and the Hydropower Force (responsible for managing hydroelectric dams) were designated as \"non-active-duty professional teams\" and reconstituted as state-owned enterprises under the supervision of the State Council.
