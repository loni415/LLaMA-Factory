The Gulf War demonstrated these through:\n- **System integration**: Multi-national troops used over 170,000 supply types in a unified joint operation, including naval Tomahawk missiles, airborne early warning satellites, and space-based positioning systems. Fighter jets were supported by helicopters, refueling planes, and electronic warfare platforms.\n- **Strategic surprise**: Air raids began at night (e.g., 2am Libya strike, 8pm Yugoslavia operation) using stealth bombers to achieve operational suddenness despite global media scrutiny.\n- **Economic gravity**: The $60 billion cost exceeded one year's GDP of most nations, highlighting how logistics consumption (3x Vietnam War levels) now determines war outcomes more than conventional battlefield victories.\n\nThis systematization meant even small operations required coordinated joint efforts to achieve hi-tech effects. **Finished.**\n"

Let me clarify:  \nThe **three networks** are:  \n1. **Radio Technique Reconnaissance Networks** (Wuxiandian Jishu Zhencha) use *military/civilian radio equipment* to monitor, intercept, and analyze enemy air raid data through multipoint observation posts with expeditionary materials.  \n2. **Surface-to-Air Sentry Nets** (DuiKong GuanCha Shaowang) leverage *terrain features and underground wired cables* for hidden radar deployment, not fiberoptic - the text specifically mentions using underground electrical cables/fiberoptics only as communication means.  \n3. **Early Warning Processing Centers** (JiSho) handle rapid analysis of enemy signals via *radio signaling specifications manipulation* and tactical deception, not physical drones or tunnels.  \n\nThe critical distinction is that electronic deception uses *simulated radio emissions/signal alteration* (e.g., false wireless transceivers, virtual EM signals) rather than fiberoptic cables as primary tools. Underground cables are only used for secure communication, not ECM. **Finished.**\n"

I thought the strategy was different regarding nuclear use and tech integration. **Finished.**\nAI: You're absolutely right to question that! My earlier answer contained several inaccuracies. Let me clarify:  \n1) **Nuclear Policy**: China explicitly refuses first use of nuclear weapons and only retaliates if attacked. This contrasts with the flawed claim about preemptive strikes.  \n2) **People's War Modernization**: While maintaining \"united three\" people's war principles, they emphasize integrating advanced technologies like precision munitions, satellite surveillance, and AI-driven command systems to create a \"technology-intensive\" military force. For example, the Gulf War demonstrated the need for real-time data processing in regional conflicts - a lesson integrated into their strategy.  \n3) **Active Defense**: The active defense concept combines physical maneuvers with technological edge like precision weapons and cyber capabilities to counter regional adversaries, not rely primarily on physical mobilization. **Finished.**\n"
