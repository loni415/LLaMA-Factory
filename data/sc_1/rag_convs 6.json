The study was in the tradition of earlier RAND research\u2014especially Fred C. Ikl\u00e9's pathbreaking work of $1 9 6 4 ^ { 1 }$ \u2014and was designed to assess the way Chinese negotiators sought to manage the process of constructing a normal relationship with the United States. Such a study, it was assumed, would also provide a useful contrast with the \"adversarial negotiations\" that had characterized dealings between the two governments in the period between the Korean War years and the unproductive negotiations of the 1950s and 1960s at Geneva and Warsaw. The principal investigator of the study, Richard H. Solomon, served as a staff member of the National Security Council during the initial years of normalization talks between the United States and the PRC and was already familiar with much of the negotiating record. Because the study drew on official negotiating documentation, the initial publication of the work was classified Secret, although an unclassified briefing summary was published by RAND in 1985.2 In 1994, a federal court action led to declassification of most of the 1985 study, based on a Freedom of Information Act suit that had been filed against the government by the Los Angeles Times. RAND is publishing the declassified parts of the study at this time because of the analytical and historical value of the work, and because of the continuing interest to the United States of managing effectively a relationship with a major country that is likely to be of even greater significance in world affairs in the coming century. The reader should be aware that about 10 percent of the original study was not declassified.

It is designed to provide guidance for senior American officials prior to their first negotiating encounters with PRC counterparts and to establish control over the documentary record of U.S.- PRC political exchanges between 1967 and 1984. This assessment is based on analysis of the official negotiating record of U.S.-PRC exchanges during this period (the memoranda of conversation\u2014\"memcons\"\u2014and reporting cables that document formal exchanges), interviews with more than thirty U.S. officials who have conducted political negotiations with the Chinese, and such additional materials as the memoirs of former senior U.S. government officials, Chinese press statements, and official PRC documentation. The basic finding of this study is that Chinese officials conduct negotiations in a distinctive, but not unique, manner consisting of a highly organized and meticulously managed progression of welldefined stages. It is an approach influenced by both Western diplomatic practice and the Marxist-Leninist tradition acquired from the Soviet Union and through dealings with the international communist movement. Its fundamental style and most distinctive qualities, however, are based on China's own cultural tradition and political practices. The most distinctive characteristic of Chinese negotiating behavior is the effort to develop and manipulate strong interpersonal relationships with foreign officials\u2014a pattern termed here \"the games of guanxi,\" or relationship games. This approach to politics is shaped by China's Confucian political tradition. The Chinese distrust impersonal or legalistic negotiations. Thus, in managing a negotiation they attempt to identify a sympathetic counterpart oficial in a foreign government and work to cultivate a personal relationship, a sense of \"friendship\" (you-yi) and obligation; they then attempt to manipulate feelings of good will, obligation, guilt, or dependence to achieve their negotiating objectives. The frequently used term \"friendship\" implies to the Chinese a strong sense of obligation for the \"old friend\" to provide support and assistance to China. # THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS American officials have characterized negotiations with the PRC as a linear process of sequential and relatively discrete stages which unfold as the two sides explore issues of common concern. This process is illustrated in the following table: The Linear Process of PRC Political Negotiations <html><body><table><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td></td><td>(3)</td><td></td><td>(4)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Opening Moves \u2022 Establish a rela-</td><td></td><td>Period of Assessment</td><td>End Game</td><td></td><td>Implementation</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>tionship with a &quot;friendly&quot; counter- \u00b7 Apply pressures</td><td></td><td>\u2022 Draw out inter- locutor</td><td>\u2022 Conclude an agreement, or</td><td></td><td>\u2022 Press for adher- ence</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>part official Establish a favorable</td><td></td><td>Test intentions,</td><td>or</td><td></td><td>\u2022 Reserve position, \u2022 Make additional demands</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>agenda</td><td></td><td>patience</td><td>\u2022 Abort the nego- tiation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gain commitment to PRC &quot;principles&quot;</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html> # Opening Moves PRC officials make a determined effort at the outset of a negotiation to establish a sympathetic counterpart official as an interlocutor, to cultivate a personal relationship (friendship) with him; they press for the acceptance of their principles as the basis of the relationship. They also seek to structure a negotiating agenda favorable to their objectives.", "metadata": "PRC Negotiating Behavior 1995 RAND.md", "judgement": true}, "2": {"text": "#Observations and implications of the first military and political chief of the newly formed group army of the Communist Party of China Observations and Implications of the First Commanders and Political Commissars of the PLA's New Group Army Chen, Chien-Pei Master of National Security and Mainland Affairs, National Chengchi University # 1. Introduction April 2017 , the CPC reorganized 13 group armies based on the original 18 group armies and announced the first military and political leaders, namely, the commander of the 71st group army, Wang Yinfang, and the political commissar, Xu Deqing; the commander of the 72nd group army, Zhu Xiaohui, and the political commissar, Wang Wenquan; the commander of the 73rd group army, Hu Zhongqiang, and the political commissar, Yang Cheng; the commander of the 74th group army, Xu Xianghua, and the political commissar, Liu Hongjun; the commander of the 75th group army, Gong Maodong, and the political commissar, Qin Shutong; the commander of the 76th group army, The commander of the regiment army, Fan Chengcai, and the political commissar, Zhang Hongbing; the commander of the 77th Group Army , Lin Huomao , and the political commissar, Li Zehua; the commander of the 78th Group Army, Wu Yanan, and the political commissar, Guo Xiaodong; the commander of the 79th Group Army, Xu Qiling, and the political commissar, Yu Yonghong; the commander of the 80th Group Army, Wang Xiubin, and the political commissar , Zhu Yuwu; the commander of the 81st Group Army, Huang Ming , and the political commissar, Fang Yongxiang; the commander of the 82nd Group Army , Lin Xiangyang, and the political commissar, Zhang Mengbin; the commander of the 83rd Group Army, Xie Zenggang, and the political commissar, Lu Shaoping. This article analyzes the reasons for their taking up their current positions and their future developments after the personnel reshuffle at the 20th CPC National Congress and the 14th National \"Two Sessions\" of mainland China (hereinafter referred to as the mainland), so as to understand the direction of Xi Jinping's layout. # 2. Subsequent adjustments to the group army leaders # 1. Promotion # 1. General vacancies # 1 , Xu Deqing in Chongzhou, Sichuan in March 1963 , he served as deputy political commissar of the 13th Group Army of the Chengdu Military Region and led a team to participate in the relief mission of the Lushan earthquake in Sichuan; In August 2015 , he was promoted to the political commissar of the 47th Group Army of the Lanzhou Military Region , and led officers and soldiers from Guanzhong, Shaanxi to the Golmud training base in Qinghai with the then army commander Zhang Lianyi. Therefore, he is familiar with the customs and folkways as well as the military-civilian relations in Yunnan, Tibet, Sichuan and other provinces and regions. In April 2018 , he was appointed as the Political Commissar of the Western Theater Command Army and stepped up the combat readiness construction of the theater command army. January 2022 , he took office as the Political Commissar of the Central Theater Command, highlighting that Xi Jinping continued to rely on Xu Deqing's cross-theater experience and rich political leadership experience, and continued to push the theater to deeply implement the new era of the Communist Party of China's military strengthening thinking and new era military strategic guidelines, complete various tasks with high standards, and create a new situation in the theater construction and preparation for war. In October 2022 , he was successfully elected as a member of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China . # 2 , Qin Shutong in Jiangyan, Jiangsu Province in November 1963 , he served as the director and deputy political commissar of the Political Department of the 31st Group Army of the Nanjing Military Region . In March 2017 , he became the first political commissar of the 75th Group Army of the Southern Theater Command. After taking up the post of director of the Political Work Department of the Army in July 2018 , he participated in the symposium of \"Learning from Lei Feng at Work and Being a Pioneer in Strengthening the Army\" in the new era and delivered a speech. By taking advantage of public opportunities to express his firm belief in Xi Jinping's position on promoting the Lei Feng spirit after taking office, he became a politically reliable learner of the Lei Feng spirit. In January 2022 , he was successfully promoted to the political commissar of the Army, and in October he was elected a member of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Qin Shutong's propaganda activities, such as publishing many journal reports and supervising many news releases, not only show his attitude highly consistent with the Party Central Committee, but also reflect that in recent years the CPC has actively cultivated propaganda professionals and political cadres as one of the considerations for promotion, and strengthened cognitive combat effectiveness to prepare for future modern warfare and to support the achievement of military combat tasks. # 3. Zhang Hongbing A native of Xianning, Hubei, he was born in January 1966. In 2014 , he was promoted to director of the Political Department of the 20th Group Army of the Jinan Military Region. In March 2017 , he became the first political commissar of the 76th Group Army of the Western Theater Command. In December 2019 , he took up the post of political commissar of the Eastern Theater Command Army, reflecting his intention to leverage Zhang Hongbing's practical experience as a political leader in different theaters to strengthen training and preparation for combat against Taiwan. January 2022 , he was appointed as the political commissar of the People's Armed Police Force, becoming the second general born after 1965. Combined with the changes in senior leaders of the People's Armed Police Force in recent years, including Commander Wang Chunning, Deputy Commander Zheng Jiagai, Director of the Political Work Department Xue Hongwei and other generals, all of whom came from the heads of the army and air force, it highlights the use of a cross-service model to ensure the unified leadership of the People's Armed Police Force and accelerate its integration into the combat system of the entire army; in addition, Wang Jianwu ( born in August 1958 ), political commissar of the Southern Theater Command, and Li Fengbiao ( born in October 1959 ), political commissar of the Western Theater Command, will reach the current retirement age ( 65 years old ) . Whether Zhang Hongbing will follow the footsteps of former political commissar of the People's Armed Police Force Zhu Shengling and be transferred to the position of political commissar of the theater command , subsequent developments are worthy of attention. # 4. Wu Yanan in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province in August 1962 , he served as deputy commander of the 16th Group Army of the Shenyang Military Region . During this period, he led the frontline command to Heilongjiang to direct flood control, rescue and disaster relief work. And the leader of the \"Pingxingguan Battle Assault Company\" model unit team commemorating the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War . July 2020 , he was promoted to commander of the Northern Theater Command Army. Less than half a year later, he joined the Joint Staff Headquarters of the Central Military Commission, serving as deputy chief of staff and deputy commander-in-chief of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, highlighting his intention to rely on Wu Yanan's major on-site command capabilities and disaster relief experience; in January 2022 , he became commander of the Central Theater Command . Before the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China , stabilizing the army is an important factor in ensuring the regime, especially the Central Theater Command that guards the safety of the capital. It was a general trusted by Xi Jinping who took office. One year later, he entered the Joint Operations Command Center of the Central Military Commission and was familiar with the military joint combat operation process. # 5 , Xu Qiling A native of Huaiyang, Henan Province , Xu Qiling was born in July 1962. He was transferred to the Central Theater Command as deputy commander of the Army in 2016. In March 2017 , he became the first commander of the 79th Army Group of the Northern Theater Command. In December 2018 , he assumed the post of commander of the Army of the Eastern Theater Command. In April 2020 , he was transferred to the commander of the Army of the Western Theater Command. This reflects that Xu Qiling's tenure covers the Central, Northern, Eastern and Western Theater Commands, and he understands the strategic directions and tasks of different theater commands and enhances his joint combat thinking. As the tension between India and China escalated, Xu Qiling was appointed as the commander of the Western Theater Command, which showed that Xi Jinping intended to rely on Xu Qiling's ground force combat experience to effectively deal with the India-China border sovereignty dispute and ethnic minority issues such as \"Xinjiang independence\" and \"Tibetan independence\" to ease the tense situation on the border. However, two months later, Xu Qiling became slightly ill. He will be transferred to the position of Deputy Chief of Staff of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission. Although he was elected as a member of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China , if he fails to be included in the list of the Central Military Commission for the 21st National Congress of the Communist Party of China , he may end up in his current position. # 6 , Wang Xiubin in Rudong, Jiangsu Province in March 1964 , he served as the commander of the 1st Mechanized Infantry Division of the 1st Group Army of the Nanjing Military Region . During his time there, he explored and researched new equipment, innovated training and combat methods, and achieved the transformation from traditional landing to three-dimensional landing combat methods. It highlights Wang Xiubin's familiarity with amphibious armored equipment and landing combat tactics, and strengthens the landing combat capability of the troops facing the Taiwan Strait. 2013 , he was promoted to deputy commander of the 31st Group Army of the Nanjing Military Region , and in 2015 he was transferred back to the 1st Group Army of the Nanjing Military Region. Group Army, served as deputy commander and commemorated the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War Leader of the \"Heroic Company of the Yanmen Pass Ambush\" Model Troop Parade at the AGM; In July 2016 , he was promoted to commander of the 1st Army Group of the Eastern Theater Command. In July 2019 , he took up the post of deputy commander and chief of staff of the Eastern Theater Command. In July 2021 , he was appointed commander of the Southern Theater Command . Since the theater command had completed the establishment of the naval and air command system during the tenure of the former commander Yuan Yubai , it is intended to rely on Wang Xiubin's practical experience in combat readiness against Taiwan to promote the theater command's combat readiness work. # 7 , Huang Ming in Yixing, Jiangsu Province in April 1963 , he served as Chief of Staff of the 16th Group Army of the Shenyang Military Region . During his time there, he served as the leader of the \"Pingxingguan Battle Assault Company\" model unit team commemorating the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War . In March 2017 , he became the first commander of the 81st Army Group of the Central Theater Command . In June 2019 , he was transferred to the deputy commander of the Army.", "metadata": "PLA_Command_Structure_Analysis_Mar2025_en 2.docx", "judgement": true}, "3": {"text": "- Politburo: Most new appointments to the Politburo have historically been members of the previous Central Committee.^461 A few individuals have also been elevated to the Politburo directly from the lower-ranking position of Central Committee Alternate Member, skipping the intermediary step of Central Committee Member.^462 At Xi's last Party Congress in 2017, two new Politburo members came from outside the Central Committee entirely, and both had personal ties to Xi.^463 Any further promotions of Central Committee Alternate Members or individuals without experience in the Central Committee at the 20th Party Congress would be noteworthy. - Retirement Ages: Because expected retirement ages for CCP leadership positions\u2020 are informal norms that have been adjusted and manipulated by top leaders over time, appointments that contravene these prevailing norms are notable when they occur. At the 20th Party Congress, the selection of any individual aged 68 or above to serve on the Politburo or Politburo Standing Committee likely indicates a particular interest in to remain China's top leader beyond the 21st Party Congress in 2027. Conversely, even if Xi does plan to step down in 2027, he may still refrain from publicly anointing a successor if he has concerns that doing so could provide a platform for that individual to challenge him prematurely. A decision to appoint a successor or successors could be a sign that Xi feels pressure from other leaders to identify an end date to his rule, or it could indicate he is confident enough in his political control that the identification of an eventual successor does not threaten his position in the interim. ^* No woman has ever served on the Politburo Standing Committee. There are also very few recent historical cases of uniformed military officers in the Politburo moving up to the Politburo Standing Committee level.

Since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, the age limit has been 67 (with no individuals aged 68 or older continuing to serve).

Similarly, a lowering of the retirement age may suggest a desire by the top leader to prevent the advancement of one or more individuals within the age band disqualified by the change. - Party Charter: In the past, the CCP has used the occasion of the Party Congress to add references to the top leaders' personal contributions to Party doctrine into the CCP Charter.* 464 Xi's signature contribution, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and BRI were included in the Party charter at the 19th Party Congress in 2017.465 Any additional changes that highlight the status of Xi's contributions would signal a further elevation of his personal status in the Party.466 - Speeches and Reports: The CCP's political work report\u2020 is an extremely important indicator of the new leadership's policy priorities that sets the tone for the next five years.467 After the conclusion of the Party Congress, speeches and public statements by newly selected CCP leaders are also important to observe. In the event Xi retains his leadership of the Party, the level of emphasis his major initiatives and policy slogans receive in these high-level statements will provide clues about his political standing and intentions following the Party Congress. ---- *Similar adjustments to the text of the PRC Constitution are generally made at the National People's Congress the following spring. \u2020The political work report summarizes the accomplishments of the previous Central Committee leadership and is traditionally presented by the previous general secretary at the opening of the Party Congress. It informs resolutions passed at the Party Congress itself and acts as an indicator of future policy priorities.

[We] should \u2014 based on the joint fire strike campaign command SoS, and focusing on the characteristics of IO command and strength application and on the situation of the IO equipment levels [standards] {zhuangbei shuiping} and [end of page 274] IO strength task organization {liliang biancheng} \u2014 keep attention on the requirements for implementing unified command $\\{ t o n g y i z h i h u i \\}$ of the multidimensionally integrated {duoyuan yiti} IO strengths, and construct a joint fire strike campaign IO command SoS, so as to form composite strength $\\{ h e l i \\}$ . Within the campaign implementation process, [we] must comprehensively apply the methods of planned control {jihua kongzhi}, ad hoc control {linji kongzhi}, targeted control {mubiao kongzhi}, and time control, to ensure implementing stable and sustained C2 over IO. For major IO activities, [we] must put into effect highly centralized and unified {jizhong tongyi} planned control. The specific {juti} IO activities of all operational groups {zuozhan jituan}, with the ad hoc adjustment control mode {suiji tiaokong fangshi} as primary, are flexibly commanded by all operational groups. [We] must, based on each operational time segment\u2019s needs $\\{ x u q i u \\}$ for IO, implement flexible command and adjustment control, to ensure that the IO targets, activities, attack modes {gongji fangshi}, and attack key points are closely complemented by and mutually adjusted-coordinated with the mid- to long-range {zhongyuancheng} fire strike activities. # III. Focusing on weakening the enemy information system\u2019s integrated-whole operational capability, and precisely selecting the key point strike targets\u2026275 Within joint fire strike, the prominent superiority of the adversary in terms of networked information systems and reconnaissance and early warning, C2, and rapid reaction will constitute a serious threat to our missile and aircraft penetration. This not only is where the main backing lies for the high-speed operation {yunzhuan} of the enemy\u2019s air defense and anti-missile SoS, but also is its distinct \u201csoft rib.\u201d Hence, conducting suppression and destruction $\\{ h u i s h a n g \\}$ of its critical information nodes, sabotaging its orderly operation $\\{ y o u x u y u n x i n g \\}$ , and rendering it blind, uncontrollable, and unable to intercept {xiangkan kanbujian, xiang kongzhi buliao, xiang lanlan buzhu} [our missiles and aircraft] thus have become the most important missions of IO. Hence, [we] must firmly establish the consciousness of active attack [offensive] {jiji jingong}, comprehensively apply multiple information attack strengths, precisely select the key point strike IO targets, and use energetic and effective active attacks {zhudong jingong} and continuous attacks {lianxu jingong}. The key points are on conducting key point jamming and suppression and destruction and sabotage against the main targets within the enemy\u2019s reconnaissance and early warning, C2, and anti-missile and air defense information systems, such as ground-based satellite receiving stations, early warning aircraft, early warning radar stations {yujing leida zhan}, [Navy] observation and communication posts {guantong zhan}, C2 centers, communication hubs, microwave communication stations $\\{ w e i b o t o n g x i n z h a n \\}$ , and military satellite communication [facilities], as well as target indication radar {mubiao zhishi leida} and missile guidance radar {daodan zhidao leida} for air defense and anti-missile weaponry $\\{ b i n g q i \\}$ ; to the maximum extent weakening and sabotaging [end of page 275] the operational effectiveness of the important electronic information systems which support {zhicheng} the enemy\u2019s integrated-whole defensive operations SoS {zhengti fangwei zuozhan tixi}; and thus weakening the enemy\u2019s integrated-whole defensive operational capability, so as to create favorable conditions for other operational activities. # IV. Centering on \u201cbeing able to defend\u201d {\u201c\u9632\u5f97\u4f4f\u201d \u201cfangdezhu\u201d}, and establishing a rigorous {yanmi} information defense system SoS\u2026276 Within a joint fire strike campaign, maintaining the security of friendly information and information systems, and concealing our operational intention, are an important aspect in seizing information dominance. To this end, [we] must [implement] strict electromagnetic [EM] spectrum management {dianci pinpu guanli}, to ensure the security of the campaign core information circulation {xinxi liuzhuan} process and of all types of electronic information systems and their critical nodes. In particular, [we] must strengthen information defense of important information system nodes, such as command communication hubs, weapons guidance and control systems, and the main-direction radar stations and observation and communication stations, and strengthen defensive measures in respects such as psychological protection and information secrecy {baomi} for the fire strike units, to ensure the smooth implementation of the joint fire assault activities. [We] must, on the basis of enhancing concealment and camouflage {yinbi weizhuang}, engineering protection, diversion and deception {yangdong qipian}, and EM [spectrum] management, exert effort to strengthen the building of an information defense SoS within the integrated air defense SoS {zonghe fangkong tixi}. [We must] emphasize using attack to aid defense {yigong zhufang}, and using active $\\{ j i j i \\}$ information attack activities within air defense operations, to attack and destroy the enemy\u2019s air raid operations SoS {kongxi zuozhan tixi}; to weaken the enemy\u2019s two great superiorities , [viz.] \u201cnon-contact\u201d and \u201chigh-precision\u201d {\u201cfeijiechu,\u201d \u201cgaojingdu\u201d} [operations]; to gain the initiative in defense; and to ensure the battlefield survival and safety of our fire assault strengths, the normal operation of C2 systems, and the smooth implementation of the joint fire assault activities. # Section 3: Activities of Joint Fire Strike Campaign IO\u2026276 IO activities within a joint fire strike campaign should be carried out by centering on the campaign phases of preliminary strike {xianqi daji}, sustained strike {chixu daji}, and follow-up strike {houxu daji}. # I. IO activities in the preliminary strike phase\u2026276 Implementing IO in the preliminary strike phase mainly centers on the activities to seize local information dominance and air dominance/supremacy {zhikongquan} [end of page 276]. It should concentrate use of most of the information attack strengths within the task organization, to execute strikes against important information system targets, such as the enemy\u2019s command communication system, radar stations, and computer network nodes; spare no effort to seize local information dominance; and to the maximum extent degrade and even paralyze the operational effectiveness of the enemy information systems, so as to ensure the smooth conduct of our joint fire strike activities. The IO activities mainly are as follows: using information reconnaissance strengths to reconnoiter and evaluate-appraise the strike effects, so as to provide target information intelligence for sustained fire assault; using multiple information attack means such as electronic jammers {dianzi ganraoji}, long-distance assisting support jamming aircraft, and electronic jamming unmanned aerial vehicles [UAVs] {wurenji} to [conduct] key point jamming and sabotage of the air defense early warning and detection systems, C2 systems, communication networks, anti-missile interception systems, and airfield navigation systems within the enemy anti-missile SoS, so as to weaken the enemy\u2019s information acquisition, transmission, and processing capability and air-defense and antimissile operational capability; in the main assault direction, using anti-radiation weapons {fanfushe wuqi} and directed energy weapons [DEWs] {dingxiang neng wuqi} to attack the enemy airborne and sea-going reconnaissance and early warning platforms, so as to weaken the enemy\u2019s battlefield posture awareness capability and to assist-support and complement the fire strike activities of the missile, air, and naval operational groups; using network warfare strengths to execute attacks against the enemy computer network systems, so as to paralyze the enemy computer networks and sabotage the integrity {wanzhengxing} of the enemy operational SoS; and applying multiple information transmission media and psychological warfare [PSYWAR] {xinlizhan} weapons to execute psychological attacks against the enemy, so as to strengthen the shock effect of the missile strikes and boost the comprehensive benefit {zonghe xiaoyi} of the missile fire strikes. # II. IO activities in the sustained strike phase\u2026277 In the sustained strike phase, the main mission for IO is to use the mode of accompanied assisting support {bansui zhiyuan} to maintain information superiority and to assist-support the firepower\u2019s sustained strike; at the same time it must have defense against attack {\u5bd3\u9632\u4e8e\u653b $y u f a n g y u g o n g \\}$ , and defend against the enemy\u2019s information attacks $\\{ x i n x i g o n g j i \\}$ . The main operational activities are as follows: the information reconnaissance strengths rigorously surveil the battlefield posture and enemy situation changes, constantly indicate targets for the fire strike strengths, and brief $\\{ t o n g b a o \\}$ them on the situation and operational effects; the psychological operations [PSYOPS] {xinli zuozhan} strengths via various media execute high-intensity psychological attacks against the enemy, to enhance the shock quality {zhenhanxing} of the joint fire strikes; and the information deception strengths apply means such as information diversion {xinxi yangdong}, release of smoke screens, and spreading of metal chaff {jinshu botiao}, to screen the fire [end of page 277] strike strengths\u2019 assault on important targets in the enemy depth. At the same time, within the process of executing sustained fire strike, our information systems and facilities equipment $\\{ s h e b e i \\}$ will be subject to the enemy\u2019s fulldimensional {quanfangwei}, multilevel, multi-means information attacks and firepower sabotage/destruction. In order to weaken to the maximum extent the enemy attack effects, [we] should adopt comprehensive measures, including EM emission {dianci fushe} control, information hiding {xinxi yinni}, electronic camouflage {dianzi weizhuang}, engineering protection, firepower screening, and using attack to aid defense, to strengthen information protection, and to defend against the ground, sea, air, and even outer space {taikong} information reconnaissance and information attacks executed against us by the enemy, to ensure the normal bringing into play of our information systems\u2019 effectiveness and the smooth conduct of the fire strikes. # III. IO activities in the follow-up strike phase\u2026278 Implementing IO in the follow-up strike phase mainly centers on the campaign activities of supplementing $\\{ b u c h o n g \\}$ and expanding the fire strikes. On the basis of the previous phase\u2019s network sabotage and severing of links $\\{$ \u7834\u7f51\u65ad\u94fe powang duanlian}, [our strengths will] conduct key point jamming and suppression and destruction and sabotage of the remaining and newly detected important information targets of the enemy, to maintain battlefield local information dominance, and to assist-support and complement the follow-up fire strike activities. Based on operational needs and requirements $\\{ x u y a o \\}$ , [we will] at the right time apply network attack means to conduct infiltration $\\{ s h e n t o u \\}$ and sabotage of various types of network systems which maintain $\\{ w e i x i \\}$ war potential {zhanzheng qianli}. [We will] apply power grid {dianwang} attack weapons; watch the situation [for an opportunity] to sabotage the enemy\u2019s electric power system; and at the right time jam and sabotage the enemy\u2019s civilian radio $\\{ g u a n g b o \\}$ , television, and telecommunications systems, to weaken the enemy\u2019s capability for assisting support to sustained operations {zhiyuan chixu zuozhan de nengli}.

There is a tendency of change from the operational procedure of achieving statistic, campaign, and strategic operational goals of three layers to the more and more blurring, even blending, of the borders of the operational goals of three layers, etc. These development tendencies are all the major changes in combat methods and ways after the massive application of hi-tech weapons and equipment. Section Three:   Factors of War Become More and More Informational, and \t\t\t\tInformational War Will Become the Basic Form of Local War under \t\t\tHigh-Tech Circumstances Information technology is the general comprehensive technology with electronic technology and micro-electronic technology as foundation and combining computer technology, telecommunication technology, and control technology. It is the grand total of all the technologies for realizing the functions of gaining, exchanging, processing, and applying information. As information technology develops rapidly and is widely applied in the military field, the level of information of the factors of war is higher and higher. Compared with combat platforms, as a strategic resource, information has a higher and higher position in war. The informationalization of the factors of hi-tech local wars is first embodied in weapons and equipment, especially in the informationalization of the main weapons. Modern hi-tech weapons and equipment all rely on computers to enhance their controllability, response speed, precision level, and destructive capability. We can say that every piece of new and hi-tech weaponry is supported and relies on information technology. There are as many as 30 computers in a M1A1 main tank; and there are as many as over 60 computers on an F-15 fighter plane. The United States Armed Forces have installed 70% of over 600 kinds of electronic warfare equipment they developed on planes, and the cost of electronic equipment on their aviation combat weapons accounts for 50% to 70% of their total cost. Secondly, it is embodied in the informationalization on the battlefield. People use digitalized technology to change various information of battle into digital information and connect the multi-dimensional battlefield into an information system through radio stations, fiber-optic telecommunication, and satellite communication, etc. realizing the integration of the telecommunication system, command and control system, intelligence transmission system, computer stations, databases on all levels, and all the end users in the whole battlefield. In \u201cthe Desert Fox\u201d operation, the supreme commanding institute of the United States almost realized the real-time knowledge of the basic situation of the battlefield, though separated from the Persian Gulf by 8 time zones, about 20,000 kilometers away. Digitalized soldiers have micro-telephone and earphones on their helmets, and they can get the superior\u2019s instructions and report to their superiors at any time, and they have computer monitors in front of their eyes, and they can tell single soldiers his accurate position on the ground and new situations on the battlefield. Thirdly, it is embodied in the informationalization in command and decision-making. The military information system with computers at its core installs some human intelligence in computer chips. It can not only rapidly collect and process various intelligence and information, automatically transmit order and report situations, and make high speed calculations, but it can also help commanders and staff members to make combat plans, simulate combat processes, select the best plan, automatically guide combat troops and attacking systems to detect targets, track targets, select attacking targets, and conduct destruction evaluation. Besides, it is also embodied in the informationalization of participating in war. The informationalization of war changes the way of participating in a war, and battlefield space and non-battlefield space merge together. Even non-professional soldiers can participate in Internet war, hacker war, and computer virus war by moving mice and typing in the computer rooms far away from the combat battlefield. The future hi-tech local war will be prepared and conducted around the collection, processing, distribution, and protection of information, and seizing and maintaining control of information will become the center and focus of operation. Information is not only the foundation of command and decision-making, but also the precondition for the effect of weapon systems to fully function, and it is a means of directly attacking enemy information targets and an important resource of influencing the overall situation of war. Information superiority will become an important factor of the result of combat, and informational combat changes into an important combat model, from the original auxiliary means, and it is in the whole process of war. The party that possesses information superiority will have the initiative of operation, while the party that loses information superiority can hardly avoid being defeated. The capacity of information warfare will become the core factor of the armed forces, and the level of digitalization of the armed forces has vital influence over the level of combat capacity. Section Four:    The Imbalance of the Development of Military Forces and \t\t\t\tTechnology Level of Two Sides of a Conflict Makes Non-Symmetrical \t\t\tCombat the Basic Model of Local War under High-Tech \t\t\t\tCircumstances As the distance of science and technology, economy and comprehensive national strength between developed countries and developing countries increases, the unbalanced military forces will exist for a long time. Some military powers constantly expand their military forces. The strong become stronger, and the weak become weaker. Their distance of military strength is larger and larger. There is even \u201cgeneration difference\u201d of times. For example, in the Kosovo War, one side of the war was the most powerful military group in the world consisting of 19 developed countries, with NATO led by the United States. Its total economic strength was 700 times that of Yugoslavia, and its total military strength was 400 times that of its enemy. It used all the new and hi-tech weapons except for nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. It conducted 78 days of high intensity remote air attacks on Yugoslavia, and the hi-tech weapons used accounted for over 50% of its total equipment. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia had only a population of little over 10,000,000, with 100,000 troops, and its total quality of weapons and equipment were backward by at least one to two generations compared with its opponent, and its number was far less than its opponents\u2019, too. This was a non-symmetrical war in which a strong military group went against a weak and small sovereign country, hi-tech against middle- and low-tech, air raids mainly using aviation forces and missiles against the air defense operation mainly using ordinary weapons. To study the winning method for the future war, one has to find out the way in this real, developing, and changed rules of war. In recent years, the theory and views of non-symmetrical combat get more and more attention of the armed forces of the countries. The meaning of non-symmetry is not limited to combat forces, but also includes operational field, combat weapons, combat forms, and combat methods, etc. \u201cJoint Operation Guideline\u201d of the United States Armed Forces requires the commander of the joint forces \u201cto seize the opportunity of conducting non-symmetrical action\u201d to use different services and all combat means to conduct non-symmetrical combat at different times and in different forms to try to get the initiative, lower damage, and rapidly collapse and defeat the enemy. In this non-symmetrical combat in hi-tech local war, the stronger side will pay more attention to applying its advantage, comprehensively mobilizing and applying all non-symmetrical combat strength, technical means, and combat forms to try to avoid getting into passiveness and try to lower the casualties of its troops and the damage to its equipment -- trying to defeat the opponent with one blow and rapidly achieving its strategic intention. Meanwhile, the weak side will also face the reality, avoid the enemy\u2019s advantage and attack the enemy\u2019s weak point, apply its unique advantage, and try to gain the battlefield initiative with non-symmetrical means and combat methods. The relations between the strong and the weak, the good and the bad, and the high and the low are relative. New and hi-tech weapons and equipment have their limitation, and the strong enemy has its weak side, too. The weak force can certainly apply its advantage against enemy\u2019s weak point, use tactics and strategies, improve combat methods to lower damage and win the victory. In the afterwards review report of \u201cAlliance Force\u201d operations, the United States Department of Defense said, Yugoslavia mainly used non-symmetrical means to fight. \u201cThese methods caused a lot of serious difficulties for our troops, and one of the lessons that we can take is, in the future, conflict, we should think beforehand that we may face similar non-symmetrical challenges.\u201d  As we can see, the strong is also afraid of the non-symmetrical means from the weak to limit or sabotage its application of its advantage and to use its weak points. This is the reason why non-symmetrical combat is paid great attention by both the strong and the weak. Section Five:   Direct Combat Space of War Decreases Gradually while Related \t\t\tSpace of War Expands Constantly The so-called space of war is the objective environment of preparing and conducting war. Space of war is also divided into the combat space of direct offensive and defensive actions and the related space of conduction of war. Compared with wars in the past, the direct combat space of the local war under hi-tech circumstance is decreasing gradually, while the related space of war is expanding constantly. The campaign space of war is decreasing, while strategic space is expanding. Looking at several local wars under hi-tech circumstances which recently happened in the world, the precision and destructive effect of weapons are greatly enhanced, the target area of direct attack of military force is more and more shown in spotted form, and the attacking targets of a war are usually concentrated in a country, a region, or certain key location, some key targets, even a single target within a specific range. The attack on planned targets also changes the \u201ccomprehensive coverage\u201d and \u201ccarpet bombing\u201d in the past; instead, it is to carefully select the vital part to conduct precision attacks. The decreasing of combat space like this is the important display of the limitation of the local war under hi-tech circumstances. There are many reasons, such as, war usually does not make occupying the opponent\u2019s territory as the goal. Limited political goals control the unlimited extension of military attack ranges. Rather intriguing international relations and world economic integration bring about related interests which help to  control the escalation and expansion of war. The international community\u2019s reaction, especially the people of a concerned country, appeal for the morality of war restricts more and more the random bombing on civilian targets by the war launcher. A hi-tech war means it\u2019s possible for military attacks to concentrate on the planned key targets more accurately; and the high cost and high risk of the local war under hi-tech circumstance also restricts the unlimited expansion of the war\u2019s scale. Meanwhile, the related space of the local war under hi-tech circumstance is expanding constantly. This is mainly out of the development of military technology and the enhancement of the combat capability of the armed forces. The development of navigation and aviation technology expands the sea battlefield from near coast to near sea and deep sea; the massive military application of planes, missiles, and submarines makes the integration of the battlefield greater and greater. The birth of hi-tech weapons such as military satellites, space shuttles, and laser weapons expands war into outer space; the rapid development of today\u2019s information technology opens the omnipresent electromagnetic battlefield. The space of local war develops from visible space to invisible space with land, all the complicated battlefield spaces such as sea, air, outer space, and electromagnet space are connected together, help each other, overlap each other, and radiate outward, forming an omni-directional, high-dimensional, all-field, multi-level hi-tech battlefield space. War may start from an electromagnetic field, from air battlefield, from combat in deep area, and military action may quickly scatter to the whole land and sea battlefields, even outer space, unfolding in all-dimensional space and there is no clear border between the front and rear area. This tendency of all-dimensional battlefields will develop constantly in future. In the local war under hi-tech circumstances, what is to be noticed in particular is that the leading position of air and outer space battlefields becomes more and more obvious. The great development of air and space technical equipment provides material and technical foundation for the confirmation of the leading position of air and outer space battlefields; the struggle in air and outer space leads the fight over the control of air, the control over sea, and the control of electromagnetic fields in the local war under hi-tech circumstances; and the development of the theory of air and outer space struggle is an important aspect of the development of the theory of the local war under hi-tech circumstances. Section Six:   Direct Combat Space of War Decreases Gradually while Related Space \t\tof War Expands Constantly Time is an important objective factor of all military activities.", "metadata": "Science of Strategy 2001 (English).docx", "judgement": true}, "9": {"text": "According to statistics, during the Gulf War, the average consumption per head of the ground troops of the United States was over 200 kilograms; the average consumption per head of airplane carrier groups was 1,100 to 1,380 kilograms. The United States troops consumed altogether 170,000 kinds of supplies amounting to over 30,000,000 tons, almost equal to half of the 66,000,000 tons of supplies consumed by 10 million Soviet Union troops during 4 years of the War of Defending the Motherland. In the Gulf War, the multi-national forces spent altogether over $60 billion dollars, more than one year\u2019s GDP of most countries in the world. Even the United States could not pay for it independently. In the Kosovo War, in order to achieve the goal of war, NATO used 1,200 planes with 38,000 sorties, launched over 1,500 cruise missiles, and dropped and fired 13,000 tons of various ammunitions. The cost of war was as high as $100 billion dollars. On the other hand, under the air raids by NATO, many military facilities, military supplies, especially strategic supply depots of Yugoslavia were destroyed, command centers and telecommunication pivots were sabotaged, transportation lines were cut off, and large amounts of civilian facilities, factories and mines were randomly bombed, suffering the economic loss of several hundred billion dollars. The increase of consumption of the local war under hi-tech circumstances cannot be separated from the upgrade of weapons and equipment, the improvement of the means of war, the increase of the intensification of war, the expansion of war space, and the pursuit after the time effectiveness of war. Hi-tech weapons concentrate advanced science and technology and high-quality work, and the research cost of weapons, purchasing cost, and maintenance costs are startling high. According to calculation, whenever the main performance of a plane is enhanced one to two times, its research cost increases 4.4 times. Compared with the Second World War, in the Gulf War, the unit price of weapons rose all the way high. The price of a tank rose from $50,000 dollars to 2 million to 4.4 million dollars; the price of a fighter plane rose from $100,000 dollars to 35.9 million to 4.25 hundred million dollars; the price of an airplane carrier rose from 7 million dollars to 3 billion to 3.5 billion dollars. The fastest delivery of combat forces is air transportation. But the cost of air transportation is tens of times the cost of sea transportation. As for the use of multiple spaces, the highest is the outer space battlefield, but the cost of developing space weapon systems will be an enormous figure. Chapter Twenty-Two The Strategic Guidance of High-Tech Regional Wars The advanced technologies involved in the measures of war in high-tech regional warfare and the form of the war becoming regionalized would definitely bring corresponding changes to the regulations of the war and the guidance regulations. The application methods of a high-tech regional war, the grasping of the nucleus of the war, and the structures of the systems of war, are all facing a series of new situations and new problems that were never faced by past wars under general technical conditions and all out war. Accurately grasping these new issues will definitely be very important to maintain the planning, initiative, and flexibility, of the strategic war guidance of the high-tech regional war. Section One:  Political and Military Goals War always demands that the political and military goals be consistent. This demand on the special content of high-tech regional war is that the limited nature of the political goals to a large extent determines the limited nature of the military goals. This limited nature is a natural consequence of the development of economy and politics of the modern international societies. After the Cold War, due to the increasing complexities and intertwining of the interests between nations, the elevation of the \u201cclarity\u201d of the political decisions of the modern societies and the war processes, the establishment of the political goals and the implementation of war are receiving more supervision and restrictions. First, the requirements of the peace and the time on the development have laid political foundations for further restricting the objectives of war. Second, the competitions of the combined national powers, which are based on the economics of the international societies and their technologies are the leading forces, and are increasing daily. The trends of globalization of the economy have quickened; the reliance and restriction on other countries has continuously deepened, thus the war decisions have received further restrictions. Third, the use of high tech-weapons and equipment for the implementation of limited political goals have provided low risks and high yield measures. The cost of the war has increased in geometric progression and has reduced the capabilities of many countries to fight wars. Thus, it simultaneously increases the necessity and possibility of controlling the war. Fourth, the modern information technology has increased the clarity of wars and it has apparently increased the restrictions on war due to the people\u2019s attitudes, which can be favorable or otherwise. The advanced communication satellites, televisions, network broadcasting technologies can provide faster, broader, and more effective measures of propaganda, which increase the restrictions on the foreign policies and war decisions of all countries. Therefore, it can strictly control the military actions within the range of limited political goals and become important content of the strategic guidance of the modern high-tech regional war. Under this background, the war is tending toward more destruction of the enemy\u2019s will and grab and maintain the strategic initiative of their own side and less on trying to attack and grab the enemy territories as the direct objectives of the war. The old concepts of \u201cYou die and I live.\u201d or \u201cIf not me, who else.\u201d are gradually becoming out of fashion. The political goals cannot continuously pursue absoluteness and thoroughness and have moved toward contrast, limitedness, and controllability. In the Gulf War, the Americans possessed military superiority; quickly developed the victorious posture; took the initiative on military attacks, the focus was on politics not military because, by that time, the Americans basically had achieved the strategic objectives of controlling the situation in the Gulf area and the strategic resources. If they pursued the \u201cultimate victory,\u201d it could have caused a new unbalance on the strategic forces of the Gulf area causing the Americans to face challenges of the American \u201cstrategic interests.\u201d In the high-tech regional war, there is more emphasis on the combined usage of various measures and methods of the military, politics, economy, and diplomacy, etc. The political solution is the ultimate selection of all concerned. The military actions are important measures to match the political solution or to create conditions for political solutions. Of course, politics should also consider the nature and characteristics of the war measures. Contrasting other measures, the war measures have clear characteristics of violence and special regulations on applications. It could cause a definite opposite effect by promoting the achievement of political goals. If there is consistency of the political goals and the nature and effectiveness of the war measures, the functions of the decisiveness can push the war toward a favorable direction. If it is not the case, the war can move toward an unfavorable direction. In truth, \u201cThe mission and authority of the art of the military is to prevent making mistakes when the politics is using this tool but does not understand the effectiveness of this tool.\u201d (1) The consistency of the military goals and political goals is an accurate reflection of the inherent relationship between the strategy and the basic interests of the nation. It is an important regulation of the planning, preparation, and application of the military struggle. By violating this objective regulation, even a good strategy will be difficult to implement. Not only will military goals not be realized, the political goals can be disturbed and destroyed. In conclusion, in the modern high-tech regional war, the principle of the consistency of the political goals and military goals not only will continue to be valid it will also become more significant. The two warring parties will still \u201cOnly use the necessary forces for the achievement of the political goals and assure the necessary forces for achieving the political goals.\u201d (2) Section Two:   Act Upon the Enemy\u2019s Action, Defeat the Enemy, and Seize the  \t\t\tEarly Opportunity The so-called \u2018Act upon the enemy\u2019s action and defeat the enemy,\u2019 is that under the situations of strategic defense, after the enemy initiated the attack, our side should grab the opportunity and use offense to defeat the enemy. This is a commonly used principle of strategic war guidance for the side which is conducting strategic defense or the side which has inferior military forces than the enemy\u2019s. \u201cAct upon the enemy\u2019s action and defeat the enemy,\u201d appears to be passive in form, but it possesses the content of positive initiative. It is a planned war method, when the strategic commander estimates that our own side is not going to be able to defeat the enemy quickly, for the sake of preserving military forces, waiting for the right opportunity to defeat the enemy. In terms of the method of war, our side takes the defensive posture at the beginning of the strong enemy\u2019s attack, upon seeing the enemy is getting tired, we then use the positive offensive actions to attack and defeat the enemy. Under the general technical conditions or an all out war, this method of war, due to its long duration, the wide area of the war zone, the effectiveness of the war measures is relatively limited. Therefore, the \u2018Act upon the enemy\u2019s action and defeat the enemy,\u2019 has more space to use this method and has more space to turn around. But under high-tech conditions, because of the limited space for war, the greatly elevated effectiveness of war methods, the short duration of a war, thus, in the entire defense posture, how to grab the early opportunity becomes the important link of winning the high-tech regional war. The so-called \u2018Grab the early opportunity\u2019 is that when two forces are at war, our side will try to grab the advantageous opportunity earlier than the enemy and initiate the offensive move and defeat the enemy. It usually uses the enemy\u2019s illusion and when they are not alert enough, implement the sudden attack. It has the effect of acting when the enemy is unaware and attacking when the enemy is unprepared. It is an effective war method of grabbing the initiative and avoiding the passiveness. The requirements of this method are: correctly judge the situations; meticulous, secretively, and quickly prepare for implementing the war; delicately use disguise and take feigning actions; wait until the enemy is tired and relaxed in their guards and attack at the time and the location that they do not expect; adopt new weapons, new methods of war, and defeat the enemy with the unexpected measure. Once the initial battle is won, use that win to firm up and expand the results of the war. Under high-tech conditions, grab the opportunities, which can disappear at any moment, and it will have particularly great significance in grabbing the initiative of the war. For the military with inferior forces, it is important to grab the advantageous war opportunities before the enemy\u2019s attack with fire-power or major sneak attacks or before the enemy is still at the stage of transporting their forces to the front and that they are not entirely assembled; adopt various effective ways of attacks, destroy the enemy\u2019s preparation for offensive moves and their high-tech war systems. This as a whole, quickly reduces the enemy\u2019s superiority and their offensive capabilities, so that it can be called an effective method of war by defeating the stronger enemy with inferior forces. Under a high-tech war, it is the competition of speed. It is the struggle for the effective time by the two antagonists. All depends upon who has the faster speed, who will occupy more effective time and will possibly grab more initiatives. For the side with high-tech, they have faster speed of maneuvering, more destructive power, and they can quickly obtain the superiority in a very short duration and cause great destruction. Thus, the side with inferior forces must strategically take the posture of  \u2018Attack upon the enemy\u2019s action and defeat the enemy,\u2019 and win the initiative. They must effectively use the strategy; the military forces; the selection of the method of war; coordination of various measures of war; the application of conditions of terrains and the weather, etc. and carefully plan; positively create advantageous war opportunity; and establish situations that are advantageous for our own side but bad for the enemy. We must use new characteristics of fighting under high-tech conditions, create and grab the advantageous war opportunity; \u2018Use the early opportunity to defeat the enemy,\u2019 in the battles and combats, and grab the status of having initiative from a state of passiveness. Under high-tech conditions, to the side which is implementing the strategic defense, the strategy of \u2018Act upon the enemy\u2019s action and defeat the enemy\u2019 is not just passively wait for a beating. The strategic \u2018Act upon the enemy\u2019s action\u2019 is based on the \u201cEarly victory\u201d of the construction of the entire national security. The \u2018Act upon the enemy\u2019s action\u2019 is a means for grabbing the initiative of politics and just cause. The purpose of \u2018Defeat the enemy\u2019 is to destroy the enemy\u2019s invasion or intention of attacks. The \u2018Act upon the enemy\u2019s actions\u2019 insists on the principle that our side will \u201cNot fire the first shot.\u201d It does not equate with giving up the \u2018Benefit of the early opportunity\u2019 in the battle and tactics.", "metadata": "Science of Strategy 2001 (English).docx", "judgement": true}, "10": {"text": "Answer: The two facets of Chinese strategic culture that I discuss in my chapter\u2014its realpolitik \u201cbones\u201d and its quasi-Confucian \u201cflesh\u201d\u2014each present U.S. policymakers with a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge presented by China\u2019s virtuocratic political culture is that the insecurities and moralism inherent in this culture may make Beijing more inflexible and inclined to self-righteous anger than might be the case for a more conventional realist power. If Washington can manage this potentially volatile emotionalism with sufficient caution and cleverness, however, it might be possible to take advantage of the regime\u2019s sensitivity to perceptions of unvirtuousness. In reading the CCP\u2019s propaganda narratives, I tend to view such prickliness over issues of image and reputation as a kind of Rorschach test by which party leaders inform us of their own vulnerabilities, letting us know how we might more effectively pressure them to behave at least somewhat better. As for the realist bones of Chinese strategic culture, the obvious challenge is that there is in reality nothing inherently pacifistic or virtuous about China\u2019s international behavior. As its power continues to grow, so also will the country\u2019s willingness to bully its neighbors and seize advantages for itself in the international arena just like any other rising power and would-be regional hegemon. At the same time, however, the very realism of the Chinese strategic tradition suggests that Beijing may be willing to moderate its behavior if those bullied neighbors\u2014and the friend they have in the United States\u2014stand up to China\u2019s hegemonic behavior. Fundamentally, a culture that understands and responds to power shifts, and that moderates its behavior on the basis of anticipated risk and opportunity, is one that can be persuaded to behave responsibly when confronted with the prospect of being overmatch. China\u2019s history of realist calculation and behavioral modulation in response to perceived shifts in power suggests that careful but firm and coordinated resistance from the other powers of the Asia-Pacific can persuade even today\u2019s increasingly aggressive Chinese regime to moderate its behavior.", "metadata": "Behind the Official Narrative China's Strategic Culture in Perspective - Chris Ford Interview.txt", "judgement": true}, "11": {"text": "Application of the method of comparison in strategic research may intensify the thinking of strategy to create new points of strategic excitement. It may also widen our vision through contrast to deepen the recognition of strategy. It may search for the trace of the development of strategy and its future trend through the reading of history so as to reveal the law of war and the law of strategy guidance on a wider background of strategy. As one form of comparative study, the contrast of world military powers has become a habitual practice of evaluating the strategic situation of the current field of strategy. The contrast report of the world military forces issued annually by the Institute of Strategic Studies of London has become an important referential index of the study of modern strategy. In addition, comparative research of strategic culture, which has a profound power of observation, has also more and more attracted the attention of strategists. Comparative research has various forms as it can do not only lateral comparison but also longitudinal comparison, not only qualitative comparison but also quantitative comparison. Lateral comparison is the comparison of things that exist at the same time, such as the comparison of strategic resources, military strength and military policies of different countries; longitudinal comparison is the dynamic comparison of one thing developed in the longitudinal surface in the order of different times, which is a perpendicular comparison or historical comparison. Qualitative comparison is to compare the properties of the essence of different things, such as the strategy of positive attack promoted by superpowers and the positive defense strategy for self-defense. Quantitative comparison is to compare things in quantity to determine their qualities in order to accurately judge the difference therein. When applying the method of comparison, we must notice the comparability of the things and the expansiveness of comparison and the comparison of essences. Despite \u201cany comparison cannot be perfect, \u201c (1)  it is undoubtedly an important ladder to help us recognize the law of strategic guidance. IV. Method of Analyzing Causes and Consequences The development of anything has its own logic, and war and strategy are no exception. Any war and strategy have the natural factors to cause their forming, and we can search for the essence and pattern of a thing by analyzing its causes and consequences. From the historical great migration of all \u201cbarbarians\u201c when the Germans dominated during the late Roman Empire and the farming and nomadic people in the edge zones mixed in different stages of development, we can find some historical messages of national conflicts on the line from the Mediterranean Sea to West Asia. History itself is the target of analyzing causes and consequences. \u201cFrom the study of history, we may get the perspective power to practical problems.\u201c (2)  Of course, we cannot take to this type of research simply, linearly and artificially or make guesses at random, nor can we start from our subjective thinking to look for one piece of evidence or two in history to record them as real footnotes. Instead, we should be guided by dialectical materialism and historical materialism and assume a very solemn attitude to carry out deep analysis and reach for the roots to find the connection between the essence of history and that of reality. V.\tMethod of Social Survey This method is a method of research which, on the basis of directly and systematically collecting the material of pertaining experiences and through analysis and collation of data, expounds the internal connection and law of development of things. This method can reveal facts and its antenna may widely penetrate into the spiritual space of people or even the society to find out people\u2019s wishes, needs and will. It has a power of strong persuasion and deep observation. This method is an indispensable mean for social workers to understand the lively society. It is an important method for strategic research as well. The factors affecting strategy are active, changing and lively. Through expansive and penetrating social surveys, we may more really observe the current situation of all types of strategic elements, understand the intention of all political forces and their mutual relationships, evaluate the possible trend of the development of strategic situations and make decisions on strategy that are in keeping with reality. Social survey may be divided into general survey, sample survey, typical survey and case survey . To strategic research, the most popular kinds are sample survey and typical survey. Sample survey is to draw samples at random or not at random to carry out cross comparison or lateral tracing observation to develop survey and obtain information. Then, we use the results of sample survey to deduct the overall form of survey. It is based on the theory of probability and stresses the survey of quantity. Type survey is to select a certain number of units and individuals as the types to conduct a close, systematic survey according to an objective and a plan. in order to obtain first-hand data. Its theoretical basis is the principle of dialectic unity of individual and common characters and stresses the revelation of essence. Regardless of the kind, the acquisition of data usually can be specifically carried out by forum (personal or group forum), observation, interview, and questionnaire. An important application of social survey is done by Rand Company of the US in 1964. It was called \u201cthe Method of Delfield (phonetic)\u201d (1)   Rand sent anonymous letters (questionnaires) to specialists (targets) to ask for their opinions, and then treated their answers by statistics to timely return the feedback to the specialists to further acquire their opinions. After several rounds of correspondence and adjustment of opinions, the feedback became unanimous and steady. The classic Delfield method required four or five rounds of exchanges to reach a conclusion. This method has been widely adopted in strategic research by the modern world. It is one of the feasible ways of collecting opinions and wisdom from strategic experts. In the process of applying the aforementioned methods to developing strategic research, we need to pay special attention to the following points and firmly grasp them: First, combining quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis. Mathematics is \u201cthe helping tool and form of performance to dialectics.\u201d (1)  Fostering the sense of quantization is very important to strategic research. Mao Zedong once criticized some people for not knowing to pay attention to the number of things by saying that, \u201cthose people do not understand to pay attention to the boundary of numbers that decides the quality of things. All of them have \u2018no number in mind.\u2019  At the end, they cannot but make mistakes.\u201d While paying attention to quantitative analysis, we, however, should be careful not to stress it to an improper degree. Military struggles are activities created by people with a purpose, such as attack and defense, righteousness and unrighteousness, encirclement and counter-encirclement, aggression and anti-aggression That number cannot indicate many outward appearances and qualitative analysis, therefore, we need qualitative analysis. Only by qualitatively understanding the quality of things can we find different solutions to contradictions. The revelation of the law of war and the law of strategic guidance by science of strategy is led by the mutual movement of a series of strategic elements, and qualitative analysis is to judge the change of the quality of these elements and the impact brought by them. Quantitative analysis mainly provides basis and material for qualitative analysis, while qualitative analysis is the flying of the quality of quantitative analysis. The result of strategic research, after all, needs to be expressed by qualitative analysis; thus, the study of science of strategy must handle well the dialectic relationship between quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis, combine them and materialize their unity with qualitative analysis as the leader. Second, combining macro analysis and micro analysis. The essential character of strategy is its wholeness; thus, strategic research must \u201cbe like a high-rise building to overlook the whole situation\u201c with an emphasis on controlling the overall tendency, and comprehensively employ the specific methods of abstraction, generalization, consolidation, comparison and deduction to mix complicated outward appearance, incident and process into different logical or theoretical systems. In order to not stick to one time and one case, to discard unrelated details and one-sided material and to strive to find the common nature and pattern of things, we need both macro analysis and micro analysis. Strategic research, however, cannot stay away from specific micro observation of certain strategic elements, such as textual research, authenticity proof, quantitative analysis, level analysis, philosophical analysis, etc. to provide reliable data, from specific to abstract, for revealing the law. Without micro analysis, macro analysis is like a wood without root and a creek without source. Without macro analysis, strategic research will forever be research at a low level unable to see the whole of things and to revel the essence and law. The high composition and high diversity of the nature of science of strategy and modern military science require macro analysis and micro analysis to be tightly combined with macro analysis as the leader. Third, combining static analysis and dynamic analysis. Static analysis is to analyze the actual situation of strategic issues at a certain time and place. It has the feature of recognizing the relative stability of the development. Dynamic analysis adds analysis of the time element of the problem and treats the whole strategic situation as a non-stop developing process: of a movement and as a process in which all strategic elements are linked to each other and function mutually to conduct a connective and orderly analysis. These two analyses become a prerequisite to each other and mutually supplement. War as a process in which two opponents combat each other, continue to readjust their strategies, keep altering their forms of fighting, and constantly deploy their troops again for fierce competition. Since the situation of war changes instantly, it is all very important to combine static analysis and dynamic analysis with emphasis on the latter. Fourth, combining special research and comprehensive research. The whole situation of strategy is a big system, containing numerous sub-systems and many aspects and phases of strategy; thus, we usually start strategic research from the special research of each aspect and phase. Special research helps us deepen our understanding of strategic  issues at a certain aspect and phase of strategy, but being relatively independent and localized, it is difficult to explain the position and function of a certain aspect and phase in the overall situation of strategy. Only by conducting comprehensive research to synthetically refine, examine and sublimate the individual and separate results of special research into an organic unity can we fully reveal war and the law of strategic guidance. Fifth, combining historical inspection and actual inspection. Strategic research is a unity of history and actuality. The former can enhance the sense of depth of history in the study and predict the trend of future development from the path of the historical past. However, strategic research is, after all, a moving body with life and vigor and its objective is guiding an actual military struggle; thus, while making historical inspection of the research\u2019s targets, we should pay more attention to inspecting and analyzing the actuality of strategy, making actual inspection as the research\u2019s basic point. Historical inspection must be subordinated to and serve the study of actuality to find a proper point of junction among history, actuality and future. Sixth, combining lateral comparison and longitudinal comparison. Lateral comparison is a comparison done in historical process, which is usually comparing one\u2019s own country with itself; while longitudinal comparison is a comparison conducted in a wider space. Strategic research particularly needs to expand the study of longitudinal comparison by placing one\u2019s own country in the large environment of global strategy to compare with other countries, other military forces, especially with realistic and potential strategic opponents. From the comparison we will find the advantage and disadvantage, and strong points and shortcomings, thereby accurately setting strategy and stratagems. \u201cComplete Works of Marx and Engels\u201d vol. 20, p. 35 (1) \u201cComplete Works of Lenin\u201d vol. 8, p. 423 2) Li Jijun: \u201cMilitary theories and War Practice\u201d Military Science Press, 1994 edition, p. 11 Section Three:  Properly Applying Scientific Methods of Research Methods with the Science of Strategy\u2019s own Characteristics There are many special methods for studying science of strategy, and the most common ones include research on war examples, war simulation, inspection of real units and comprehensive analysis of military situation, etc. I. Method of Study of War Examples The fact that wars and military struggles never repeat makes it difficult for researchers to have the condition to exercise the same strategy in real wars. Study of war examples is perhaps a good way to compensate and substitute this loss of opportunity. For writing \u201cOn War,\u201d Karl von Clausewitz studied more than 130 war examples and compiled seven volumes of war history. Jomini (phonetic), the author of \u201cDiscussion of the Art of War,\u201d wrote several military history books, such as \u201cMilitary History  Commenting War of Revolution 1792-1801,\u201d and the \u201cHistory Commenting War of Federick (phonetic)\u201d and \u201cNapoleon\u2019s Political and Military Life.\u201d Exactly like what Romini said, \u201cA military history containing correct comments is indeed a great school of real wars.\u201c (1) Anatomizing war examples is likly to have a dialogue on strategy with historical strategy directors and military commanders as it may give us the needed experiences and teachings from their victories and defeats in guiding wars. Like legal workers to cases of their trade and medical practitioners to examples of ailment, strategic researchers should take study of war examples as a fundamental practice because it is an essential way to know the law of guiding strategy.

Since that time, a series of historic changes with far-reaching impact have taken place. The informational social forms, multi-polar strategic structures, integrated global economy, and the world\u2019s high-tech military have been increasingly affecting and changing all the sectors of human society, including the outlook and process of the military domain, as a logical result of international economic, political and military technology development. High-tech local wars have taken the stage of modern wars, and become the main form of modern wars. The unfolding world military revolution is bringing powerful impact to a series of traditional concepts and modes of operations in the military domain. The rapid development of war practices urgently requires new theoretical interpretations of new issues, new situations and new characteristics that have emerged in the military domain, and a new summation for the rule of war and the rule of war guidance. In order to suit the developments and changes of strategic situations, in 1996, the Department of Strategic Research of the Academy of Military Science decided to carry out the project of researching and compiling the new edition of ((The Science of Strategy)). This project was listed as a priority project of the Academy of Military Sciences, as well as a priority project of the \u201cNinth Five-Year Plan\u201d of the entire Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army. On the basis of four-years of academic preparation and preliminary research works, the overall compiling work began in July, 2000. The book was finished after a whole year of collective efforts of the Project Group. During the process of compilation, the Project Group made every effort in following the guidance of Marxism\u2019s scientific view of war and its view of strategy, setting our foot on our own national situation and the situation of our armed forces, and combining inheriting and developing, as well as creating and drawing on the experience of others in working out a book of strategic theories with Chinese and time characteristics, which has a practical guiding significance for carrying out military strategic policies in the new era. During the compiling process, the following three points were highlighted:  1. Paid attention to write around the war, grasped the essence and connotation of wars, in order to avoid over generalization of the connotations of war and strategy; 2. paid attention to try great efforts in searching for rules, including the general rules of wars and strategy, and special rules for high-tech local war and its strategic guidance; 3. paid attention to the need of developing academic disciplines that are suitable for strategic sciences, made every effort in building up and completing the development and progresses made to our strategic theoretical systems. We hope that through our efforts, we can win local wars under modern, especially high-tech, conditions, in order to provide useful theoretical deep thought for military development and military school teaching in the new era. The Project Group was led by Director Yao Youzhi, Peng Guangqian was responsible for frame design, organization and implementation, the group members were mainly drawn from fellows of the Department of Strategic Research of the Academy of Military Sciences, and experts from both inside and outside the academy were also invited to carry out this project. There were more than 40 experts who participated in various compiling stages of this book. Among them, there were 4 tutors of doctorate candidates, 8 fellows, 10 assistant fellows, 12 doctors, and 9 masters. After the initial draft was completed, Peng Guangqian, Liang Xiaoqiu, and Huang Xing worked on the initial editing, and Peng Guangqian made the final editing and approval. Before his passing, Deputy Director Dai Yifang paid close attention to the work of this book. Yu Qifen, the former Director of Strategic Research Department, led the academic preparation work in the early stages. Fu Liqun, the Deputy Director of the Department of Strategic Research and Yin Bing, the chief of the First Office of the Department participated in organizational leadership work in the early compiling stage. Mao Zhengfa, Wang Xuhe, Liu Hongsong, and Miao Xiaoping participated in the early stage of preliminary research and prepared part of the first draft. Wang Zengquan, former chief of the Second Office, Zhang Shiping, Chief of Department of Academic Investigation and Research, Department of Scientific Reasearch Guidance, Deng Xiaobao, Editor-in-Chief of ((Military Sciences of China)) Magazine, and Ma Guangwu, Chief Editor of Miltiary Sciences Press participated in the examining and approving works of this book, and they provided a lot of constructive opinions. Gao Tiejun, Fellow of Department of Strategic Research contributed hard work in examining and proof reading this book. There have never been changes as deep and rapid as current changes in the realms of war and strategy, not only the directions of future wars can not be grasped easily; it is also difficult to just understand the nature of the already emerged changes. To this day, there are still different views of key academic issues in the academic circle. Although the Project Group tried hard to be close to the essence subjectively, every individual\u2019s knowledge, however, can not avoid being limited. Whether or not this book can provide readers with precise and appropriate views and comments, we have to let it be examined through practices, we also welcome generous comments from knowledgeable readers. The Author October 8, 2001", "metadata": "Science of Strategy 2001 (English).docx", "judgement": true}, "13": {"text": "Chapter 5: Theory \nThis study investigates to what extent Confucian morality influences Chinese university students\u2019 opinions about the use of force. Stated beliefs and views are tested for consistency and coherence with Confucian values. Ethical theories must be fairly broad in order to be useful for a wide range of situations but this also allows for numerous legitimate interpretations of what is moral while also not providing clear metrics for what falls outside of this spectrum. While the goal of this study is to validate the role of only Confucian ethical theory, the intricacy and diversity of human reasoning as well as the many potential sources of influence and bias complicate the creation of decision making models that are suitably comprehensive yet also necessarily succinct. This chapter outlines foundational concepts and defines critical terms of ethical theory and moral reasoning. It discusses which challenges/limitations must be addressed in order to ensure the legitimacy of the research and how the findings from prior studies have been incorporated into the survey design and statistical analysis to allay them. First, the current consensus about ethical theories and moral reasoning as well as how best to build quantitative models of them are reviewed. The same is then done for their relationship with international relations and foreign policy decisions. Finally, since most of these studies are based upon Western ethical theories and use Western respondents, the implications of cultural differences between Western and Asia are considered. Particular emphasis is given to how the findings from prior studies are used to improve the accuracy of the survey instrument, of analyzing the results from the survey, and of the models built from this analysis. This provides critical context to understand how the limitations of this project are mitigated. MORAL REASONING \nMearsheimer says of theories about state behavior , \u201cNormative theories can be valuable tools for understanding the constraints imposed on states by the international system, whether or not states actually heed them, and they can affect how states interact with each other\u201d. Like other studies that seek to model moral decision making, this one uses the distinguishing characteristics of the established normative frameworks for the major Western ethical philosophies to categorize and scale the beliefs of respondents. It also considers how Confucian values might lead to important differences. The personal values and beliefs which comprise a normative system play a critical role in resolving moral conflicts - especially for situations where there is no way to sidestep the conflict. Schlenker and Forsyth suggest, and later studies support, that \u201can individual\u2019s moral philosophy, or ethical ideology, is the key factor in ethical judgments\u201d. This overarching system of beliefs creates an \u201cethical orientation\u201d which \u201cis the predisposition that influences an individual to distinguish right from wrong. It is a cognitive framework that affects\u2026awareness of ethical issues, process of problem solving, choice of ethical principle, and administrative acts\u201d. Guided by underlying ethical orientation or ideology, James Rest adds that the process of ethical behavior involves 1) moral sensitivity/recognition; 2) moral judgment or reasoning; 3) moral motivation/intention; and 4) moral character/action. Moral sensitivity is the awareness that the issue contains a moral problem. Moral judgment/reasoning is the process used to find the most moral way to resolve the moral problem. Moral motivation is the desire to actually do what has been identified as the best moral option \u2013 even when doing so is to the detriment of self-interest or expediency. Moral character is the ability to pursue doing the right option despite the substantial difficulties that may need to be overcome to do so. Schlenker and Forsyth were some of the first to explore the relationship between an individual\u2019s moral philosophy and the extent to which their decisions are influenced by moral beliefs. They propose that the likelihood of an individual to choose the ethical option when faced with a conflict correlates with the degree to which that individual has both idealist and relativist beliefs about morality. Moral idealism measures the extent to which it is believed that upholding moral principles will lead to the best consequences. In other words, whether doing the morally right thing will lead to the morally right result. Moral idealists are more likely to identify, use, and strictly adhere to moral beliefs in their decisions and behavior. They also tend to be less tolerant of immoral behavior. The importance of moral beliefs and principles is primarily founded upon teleological14 considerations so it is logical that idealists also exhibit altruistic tendencies such as strong \u201cconcern for minimizing negative consequences and maximizing gain, particularly for others\u201d. While idealism measures to what extent individuals believe that strictly following moral rules can ensure the best outcome, relativism is concerned with the universality and efficacy of moral rules to provide proper guidance for all moral conflicts. Strong relativists emphasize consideration of context and predicted moral or self-interested consequences rather than strict adherence to deontological universal moral rules. Relativists are also more likely to acknowledge that \u201cin some cases harm is unavoidable, and that one must sometimes choose between the lesser of two evils\u201d. Forsyth developed the Ethical Position Questionnaire to test where an individual fell on these scales. Although the EPQ is still used in many studies, Forsyth and others admit that results from it do not tell the whole story. As Forsyth et al. say,\u201d Indeed, as cross-cultural psychologist Bond noted, to assume that a measure that was developed with U.S. citizens can be used without reservation with those with widely differing cultural backgrounds is imperialistic, particularly when researchers focus so exclusively on idealism and relativism that they ignore other, indigenous, aspects of morality that are unique to a given cultural context\u201d. Thus, the idealist/relativist categorical distinction contributes valuable insights about the nature of moral beliefs but it presents an incomplete picture. To fill in important gaps, studies have sought to identify overarching ethical theories that likely \u201creflect high-level systemization of approaches already intuitively taken in everyday decision-making\u201d. These deontological and teleological frameworks provide simplified guidelines for ensuring that the weighing of conflicting moral values is done with consistency and coherence. Studies have indeed found that \u201clay persons find the distinction between consequentialist and deontological considerations meaningful\u201d and that even the deontological doctrine of double effect \u201ccan reliably influence moral judgments\u201d. Deontological and teleological moral reasoning are fundamental characteristics of moral reasoning as they \u201care two nomothetic regularities that appear consistently across most people\u201d. Testing for this distinction within a quantitative study of moral reasoning is further insightful because it has also been found that those who are more inclined to use deontological reasoning rather than teleological reasoning also demonstrate greater inclination towards choosing the moral option. This may, in part, be related to the finding that ethical decision making tends to place greater emphasis on the morality of how a goal is pursued than the morality of the actual goal. This study accordingly follows those others by creating conflicts between deontological and teleological principles to provide \u201ca simple and clear measure of which principle an individual favors\u201d. The survey also tests the requirement of consistency in moral reasoning by giving the same moral motive while varying which principle would justify the act. Because idealists are more likely to hold deontological beliefs while relativists are more likely to support teleological reasoning, this approach also addresses the idealist/relativist measures while better compensating for cultural bias. Normative ethical theory tells the individual how one ought to measure equally important but conflicting principles yet it does not help prioritize any moral value over another. For example, a deontologist would consider how to uphold moral duties rather than consequences but not whether honesty or filial piety is the more important duty. Thus, the ranking of values, where values are defined as \u201cthe individual\u2019s prescriptive beliefs concerning the desirability of certain modes of conduct or end-states of behavior\u201d , as well as the normative moral philosophy of the individual \u201cplays a dominant role in making ethical decision\u201d. Because moral values have an equal prima facie obligation to be upheld, there are many defensible ways to rank them. Lawrence Kohlberg suggests that the metrics used to rank values changes as an individual\u2019s education and awareness of the world around them matures their moral philosophy. Following Plato, Kohlburg believes this process is essential to the discovery and pursuit of virtue \u2013 or what is the \u201cideal good\u201d. The least sophisticated method for judging what is moral \u2013 or what is the ideal good \u2013 is to do so based upon how the consequences of their decision would impact that individual. As their concept of what is good/moral matures, their moral reasoning advances through Kohlburg\u2019s six stages until, finally, morality is based upon justice. Said another way, there is a shift \u201cfrom simpler, punishment-oriented thinking to more principled thinking\u201d where upholding justice is the highest goal. According to Kohlburg, since it is the universal desire of all humans to discover the ideal good and since justice is universally that ideal, culture may influence the rate at which moral reasoning develops but the path and stages of moral development are the same for all. Yet this argument is predicated on a notion of justice that is defined by equality and reciprocity. As a result, Kohlberg\u2019s scale and Rest et al.\u2019s Defining Issues Test - upon which it is based - have received substantial criticism. The prioritization of the Western liberal notions of justice and the rights of the individual as the highest order values means that those who hold different views would be scored as having less mature moral reasoning according to the DIT. For example, some critics suggest that men are more inclined to evaluate ethical issues with the priority being justice while women are more inclined to account for situational context. Thus, Carol Gilligan, one outspoken critic, proposes an alternate ideal good that prioritizes considerations of care rather than justice. Some also believe that culture, language, and other contextual sources of morality are underappreciated. Relatedly, other critics point out that both Kohlberg and Gilligan\u2019s notions from which morality is measured are similarly founded upon the individual as the basic unit of consideration and so fail to consider collectivist conceptions of morality that might prioritize \u201cgroup-level concerns about social order, authority, duty, loyalty to one\u2019s family or group,\u201d etc.. Investigations into the possibility that differences in values may lead to divergent methods of moral reasoning have found that \u201cethical priorities, not wholly different sets of values, underlie the variations in ethical perception and judgment\u201d. In particular, the list of values considered relevant to moral reasoning is found to remain largely the same across cultures but there is substantial variation of which values are deemed more important to be upheld or even considered. Even organizational culture effects the objective importance of upholding moral values \u2013 that is to say how important it is to actually do the right thing and choose the ethical option. One important way that organizations and communities legitimate and then promulgate what are normative values and how they should be used to address complex moral issues is by creating an ethical climate or culture that is purported to represent \u201csocial consensus\u201d. As a result, studies of moral reasoning such as this one focus on how the ideologies of specific cultures or other organizational communities influence where values come from, how they are ranked, their role in moral decision making, and what other factors might influence this One of the earliest of such studies - and one of the most important to the validation of this theory - was done by Graham et al. In order to do this while accommodating cultural differences in how morality is defined based upon different ranking of values, they designed the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. The MFQ asks individuals to define their conception of morality by assigning relative importance to the five value pairings or \u201cpsychological \u201cfoundations\u201d upon which cultures construct their moralities\u201d - Harm/care, Fairness/reciprocity, Ingroup/loyalty, Authority/respect, and Purity/sanctity. These categories, importantly, account for a morality that prioritizes virtues over rules; the interests of the group over those of the individual; and emotional/intuitive over more systematic reasoning. Doing so is especially useful when building a common framework so as to compare the ethical priorities of collectivist and individualist as well Confucian belief systems. Indeed, results from the MFQ found that respondents from South, East, and Southeast Asia show more concern than those from Western cultures for the Ingroup and Purity values although they were about the same for Authority. Also, somewhat unexpectedly, the cross-cultural comparison of MFQ results found little difference between Asian and Western cultures in the importance assigned to Harm and Fairness. Other studies similarly found consistency in the moral reasoning and the ranking of values of a specific culture and systemic variation of these between cultures. Forsyth et al. believe that their Ethics Position Theory help explain these cultural variations. EPT breaks down an individual\u2019s \u201cethical ideology\u201d into four categories, defined by the individual\u2019s beliefs and support for ethical relativism (\u201cconcern for principles\u201d) and idealism. The collectivist emphasis on \u201crelationships, with moral obligations based upon respect, trust, and a sense of community rather than general, cross-situational moral dictates\u201d leads to the expectation that Confucian societies would fall more on Forsyth\u2019s idealism side of the moral philosophy scale than Western individualist societies.", "metadata": "dis_ch5_2.txt", "judgement": true}, "14": {"text": "Command of space operations cannot do without all-around and careful command support.

In particular, they should set up several anti-laser-guidance and counter-IR-reconnaissance measurement devices such as smoke screens, water sprayers, and false-IR sources, and mutually combine them with other deception means as well as means of command concealment, to constitute a \u201cshield\u201d which can effectively ensure the security of the friendly space operations command institutions. When organizing command communication support, they should perform forecasts and analyses of the missions undertaken by space operations command institutions at all levels and of situations which can be encountered when signal communication is jammed and sabotaged by the enemy; study and formulate handling COAs for different special situations; lay stress on the key points and rationally deploy communication facilities equipment and technical strengths; and adopt multiple effective means to construct multipath bypassing communication circuits, to ensure the smooth and unblocked flow of signal communication among all command institutions on the ground and in space, and between the command institutions and the units. # Section 2: The Command SoS for Space Operations\u2026163 The command SoS for space operations signifies the organic integrated whole of all levels and all types of space operations command institutions, according to the composition of command relationships. It is an important foundation on which all levels of commanders and their command organs implement organized command of the space operations activities of their subordinate units. A scientific and rational command SoS for space operations enables shortening of the command flow path and is beneficial to command coordination and to boosting of command efficiency. # I. Basic requirements for constructing the command SoS for space operations\u2026163 Construction of the command SoS for space operations has its own special requirements. [Commanders and their command organs] must abide by the characteristics and laws of space operations, adapt to the general requirements of the operational command SoS, and bring them into the command SoS for joint operations, for synchronous building and perfection of the space operational forces. 1. Abiding by the laws of command of space operations Command of space operations, besides abiding by general operational characteristics and laws, also should be organized and implemented according to the unique characteristics and requirements of space operations. First is [a need] to abide by the laws of high-level command. In space operations, unlike other operations, the participating strengths mostly are strategic forces, and the operational objectives mostly are enemy strategic targets; moreover, the success or failure of operations will have a bearing on success or failure in other battlefield operations and even on victory or defeat in an entire war. Hence, command of space operations must be by the Supreme Command or by a theater\u2019s joint operations commander [JOC] and his [end of page 163] command organs and must conscientiously realize unified command according to the supreme commander\u2019s intent; it cannot permit the least bit of error. Next is [the need] to abide by the laws of precision and high efficiency. Due to the universal application of IT, the informationized degree of all spacecraft, weapons and equipment, and ground launch and TT&C installations and facilities equipment within space operations is growing ever higher, and the capabilities for precision control and long-range strike have greatly improved. For operations under informationized conditions, this causes an acceleration of the tempo, greater preciseness, and unprecedented increases in operational efficiency. Given the pressing needs and requirements of real situations, the command SoS for space operations must be streamlined and smooth, in order to realize precision and high efficiency in command. Third is [the need] to abide by the laws of integrated linkage {yiti liandong}. The wideranging application of IT enables a variety of operational strengths to be employed in parallel, and enables the operational effectiveness of various types of weapons to be interlinked, so that operational capabilities are accumulated and released within a short time, thus leading to great increases in operational efficiency and acceleration of the course of operations. This feature has increased the degree of difficulty in command of space operations, and in particular has increased the degree of difficulty in scheduling of space operational forces, adjusting of operational objectives, and adjusting-coordinating of operational activities. This in turn has put forth requirements, unprecedented in history, on command of space operations with integrated linkage. 2. Bringing [the space operational forces] into the Joint Operations Command SoS Space operational forces are a new type of operational strength and one whose position and role is very important. They must be brought into the joint operations SoS, and their command SoS similarly must be brought into the Joint Operations Command SoS. First of all are the needs and requirements for centralized unified command. Centralized unified command is a military rule particularly stressed by strategists in ancient and modern days both in China and abroad and one which has been repeatedly proven in military practice. It requires that all operational strengths must be under unified command by one commander and his command organ. In local war under informationized conditions, the classes of operational strengths are more numerous, which similarly requires abiding by the principle of centralized unified command. Space operational forces serve as an important component of the joint operational forces; they not only can be independently employed, but also can be employed as complementation to other forces. While concentrating the space operational forces to seize space dominance, [their commanders and command organs must] coordinate with other forces seizing information dominance, command of the sea, and command of the air, and inflict heavy strikes on the enemy\u2019s effective strength, to seize victory in campaign combat. Objective reality requires that the command SoS in space operations must be brought into the Joint Operations Command SoS and come under unified command by the JOC and his command organ. Otherwise, it could result in [situations where] each department acts on its own, and too many heads issue commands; the units thus could not know what course to take, their operational effectiveness would be lower, and they could even be disorganized and defeated in battle. Next are the needs and requirements for interconnection and intercommunication in the command information system. The space operational forces and other operational strengths are not mutually isolated or mutually unconnected; instead, they are mutually supplementary and mutually promoting, with natural close ties between them. During operations, the other operational activities and the space operations activities will all need mutual assisting support and close complementation. Objective reality requires that the command information system for space operations and the command information system for other operational activities [end of page 164] are interconnected and interoperable, even to the point where the needs, activities planning, and activities results of the space operational forces and of the other operational strengths can be timely transmitted from one side to another and mutually exploited, to jointly boost the operational effects of an entire campaign. Third are the needs and requirements for boosting the benefits of building. Although the space operations command SoS has its special quality, nonetheless in overall terms it belongs like other command SoS\u2019s to the operational command SoS\u2019s, and they all have common characteristics and laws to be observed. On one hand, all operational command SoS\u2019s must be treated as one integrated whole, with unified operations-research-based planning done by one institution, which will concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources; carry out unified building; lay stress on the key points; and invest the limited funds in the most urgently needed and most important building, to guard against causing unnecessary waste of materiel. At the same time, this can ensure that all command SoS\u2019s have the same form and the same xitong system, and ensure their mutual interconnection and intercommunication, to constitute one organic integrated whole. On the other hand, under the premise of unified building, [commanders and their command organs] also must appropriately give consideration to the special quality of the space operations command SoS, and guard against always following the same pattern, to boost the directed [focused] quality and practicality of command of space operations. 3. Adapting to the general requirements of operational command The command SoS for space operations serves as one type of operational command SoS. Compared to the Joint Operations Command SoS and the service operations command SoS, it has a similar task organization and organizational grouping, performs similar functions, brings into play similar functions, and similarly also must conform to the requirements of general command SoS\u2019s. The requirement for centralized unified command: \u201cCentralized unified [command] is a basic requirement for operational command in terms of the principle of the goal-driven quality of war and of composite strength to gain victory, and was a basic principle of operational command in ancient times.\u201d12 The space operational forces are very numerous, but mainly include space launch units, space TT&C units, space early warning units, space offensive operations units, and space defensive operations units. In order to have these forces form composite strength, [commanders and their command organs] must have scientific and rational command institutions, implement centralized unified organizing and command over them, and thus establish unified command authority with a high degree of authoritativeness. They must employ unified operational thought, operational objectives, and operational planning, to unify the activities of all these space units. The requirement for layer-by-layer command: \u201cThe control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.\u201d13 The meaning here is that if one wants to properly manage armed forces numerous in numbers of men, just as if one wants to properly manage armed forces few in number of men, one must organize them well. The specific method is to partition the armed forces into a certain number of components and implement level-by-level and section-by-section management. Speaking from the standpoint of management science, management exhibits spans. Under present technical conditions, [end of page 165] when the objects of management are in the range of 5-10, [the span] is relatively rational; but when this number exceeds 10, management institutions often may not be able to withstand the heavy burden, so that the phenomenon of a decline in management efficiency is seen. Today, space operational forces are undergoing full-speed development, their scale is constantly expanding, the equipment comes in many types and varieties, and the scope of disposition and spaces employed are constantly being extended; moreover, the functions not only include tactical and campaign functions, but also strategic ones. Thus, layer-by-layer command must be implemented over this type of operational strength, with mutual supplementation and mutual linkup among the layers. In reality, this then has formed a command SoS for space operations. The requirement for sustained stability: command which is unstable or interrupted will cause loss of contact with the units, and the resultant outcome naturally will be a collapse without even going into battle. Along with the development of modern reconnaissance technology and the application of precision strike weapons, and in particular the rise of information warfare [IW], command systems, acting as the armed forces\u2019 operational", "metadata": "2022-08-12 Lectures on the Science of Space Operations.md", "judgement": true}, "15": {"text": "Commentary implies criticism and risk, and media organizations have little energy and willingness to take on the censorship risk of online commentaries, in addition to reviewing paper-based commentaries. In particular, the WeChat public number of the comment department represents the voice of the organization, and online comments can have a wide impact, making it an unbearable burden for many media outlets. As interviewee D put it: \"Individuals can 2015NO.5 (General 387) 1994-2022 China AcademicJournalElectronic Publishinghouse. allrights reserved. lit. collect and edit light art Second. Most media have not established a clear system of rewards and punishments for the operation of WeChat, resulting in insufficient motivation to open and operate the program. Unlike the editors of traditional comment boards, the operation of WeChat public numbers has to take into account the language expression characteristics and dissemination mechanism of new media platforms in addition to the selection and writing of articles, requiring more energy to interact with the users and requiring commentators to master more new media skills, which is a human and material resource constraint to the opening of WeChat public numbers of comment boards in media organizations. In addition, some media organizations focus their efforts on building aPP, which already includes a commentary section, such as the Oriental Morning Post's \"Surge\", in which case there is little incentive for the commentary department to do another WeChat public number. In terms of commentators' personal WeChat public numbers, of the 17 media commentaries interviewed, six media outlets, including Beijing Youth Daily, Yangtze River Daily, Oriental Morning Post, Nanfang Daily, Huashang Daily, and the Channel Herald, did not have any personal WeChat public numbers for their commentators. The other 11 media outlets did have personal WeChat public numbers, with the most in the Southern Metropolis Daily, which had five, and two media outlets with non- commentary personal WeChat public numbers for their commentators. There are also two media outlets whose commentators have opened personal WeChat public numbers that are not commentaries. In terms of part-time jobs, the Huashang Daily has a system that does not allow commentators to accept part-time jobs, but the Yangcheng Evening News agrees and encourages commentators to be hired to participate in a variety of activities, such as lecturing at colleges and universities, or serving as judges and guests of honor; and the commentary department of the Southern Metropolis Daily has always cooperated closely with public welfare organizations, and its commentators and Beijing-based commentators have participated in public welfare organizations. I can write and express myself more freely. However, the department's public number is subject to very strict censorship and regulation, which means that the organization itself is very cautious in all aspects.\" 3. \u0000 In fact, even if some media review departments have opened their WeChat public numbers, they are careful to \"cut\" their names from the organizations they work for to avoid unnecessary trouble, for example, the WeChat public number of the Southern Metropolis Daily is called \"Difficulty\". According to interviewee c, \"This is a glimpse of the dilemma of the so-called transformation of traditional media. The influence that traditional media have accumulated in the past does not play any role in WeChat communication. Instead, the institution itself has become a liability, most notably in terms of the scale of expression, which is still restricted by the institution, albeit slightly more lenient than newspapers, but far less flexible than individuals. In this sense, WeChat is de-institutionalized. Interviewee G agrees, arguing that institutional commentary is \"too restricted, and individual speech does not need to take too many factors into account\". Third, for individual commentators, they prefer to speak through their WeChat public numbers, which is more flexible and conducive to personal branding. Currently, the media does not require commentators to report their personal WeChat public numbers to the organization like they report their personal microblog accounts. Commentators' comments on WeChat public numbers are at their own risk and less linked to the organization, which makes them freer to speak than on microblogs; moreover, the reward function of WeChat public numbers can also help commentators to develop a new income- generating channel to a certain extent. Changes Chinese News Commentary Media Convergence  Based on Interviews 17 Media Commentators 2015_zh Page 4 of 7 http://www.cnki.net Secondly, WeChat has further leveled the playing field for individual operators. 1994-2022 China AcademicJournalElectronic Publishinghouse. allrights reserved.

Scarcity of views: original, unique, non-mainstream insights; 3. Timeliness of expression: timely, the first time to express their views. The hotspots are well captured; 39 4. style of expression: naughty, funny language, innovative writing style; 5. relevance to oneself: sponsored by one's own ministry; However, compared with individual WeChat, institutional WeChat also has its own advantages, such as more stable article quality, relatively abundant resources, and guaranteed publication cycle. Under the circumstance of rich and diversified subjects of speech and the rise of self-media, there is still a significance for media organizations to express their voices through commentaries, and media commentaries departments should recognize this problem and think about how to make their voices and positions influence more audiences. The difference between WeChat and institutional operations is that all WeChat public numbers are equally \"collapsed\" into the \"subscription\" of WeChat users and are presented in the order in which they are pushed out, unlike microblogging platforms that offer certification or promotion services to institutional users. Moreover, for many netizens, they do not care whether a public number is run by an individual or a team, but rather the content and opinions provided by the WeChat public number. In addition, the main factors mentioned by the reviewers who gave reasons for recommending WeChat are: 3. The proliferation of self-publishers and the increasing diversity of commentators and comment standards When summarizing the recommended microblogs for personal commentary, it was found that the most mentioned by commentators was \"Old News Commentary\", 7 times; followed by \"Wang Wusi\", 4 times; and \"Poisonous Tongue's Poison\", 3 times. The second was \"Wang Wu Si\", 4 times; the third was \"Poisonous Tongue of Poison\", 3 times. From the above summary, we can see First, the earlier the WeChat public number is opened, the more advantageous it is in terms of influence, because it has accumulated a certain influence before other WeChat public numbers appeared, and has maintained this influence relatively stably in its subsequent operation, such as \"Unity Lake Reference\" (\u56e2\u7ed3\u6e56\u53c2\u8003), \"Old News Review\" (\u65e7\u95fb\u8bc4\u8bba). \"Old News Review\". Moreover, the definition of news commentaries on new media platforms is further blurred, and many articles cannot be called news commentaries in the strict sense of the word. They have a larger scale of expression, are more personalized, and are more adept at using pictures, videos, cartoons, and other means to enhance their persuasive effect. In summarizing the institutions or organizations recommended by the interviewees, it was found that \"Lake Unity Reference\" was mentioned most frequently by the commentators, with a total of 8 times; followed by \"Chivalrous Island\", with 3 times; \"Maritime Warehouse Insider \"Zhigu Trend\", \"Xinjing Newspaper Review\" and \"Boiling\" were all mentioned 2 times; others such as \"People's Daily Review\" and \"Jin Jin\" were mentioned 2 times. Commentary\", \"Jintai 2\", \"Elephant Guild\", \"What to do\", \"Knowledge Bureau Others, such as \"People's Daily Commentary,\" \"Jintai 2,\" \"Elephant Guild,\" \"What's Up,\" \"Knowledge Bureau,\" \"Media Notes,\" \"Wu Xiaobo Channel,\" \"CCTV News,\" \"Everyone,\" \"Consensus.com,\" and \"The New York Times,\" have been published twice. \"Consensus\", \"Difficulty\", \"Zhixia Forum\", \"Red Pepper\", etc. were all mentioned only once. etc. were mentioned only once. From Table 2, we can see that the scale of commentaries in traditional media is not large, except for Beijing Youth Daily, Yangtze River Daily, Southern Metropolis Daily and People's Daily, which have more than 10 people in their commentaries, the number of commentators and editors in other media is in the single digit, with the smallest ones, such as The Straits Herald (which doesn't have a commentaries department) and Xinxin Express, having only one full-time commentator in their commentaries. With such a size of commentary team, it is difficult to arrange enough manpower to deliver the voice of the media's commentary department to the Internet, in addition to completing the task of editing and writing the commentary pages of the daily paper edition. In the interview, the author learned that many commentators do not pay special attention to those public numbers for commentaries. When asked what personal or institutional microblogs for commentaries are worth recommending (there is no limit to the number of microblogs), a commentator said bluntly, \"There is nothing to recommend, I think everyone has different tastes and interests and pays attention to different public numbers. Personally, I like public numbers that are a bit more literary, a bit more life-oriented, and a bit farther away from the hot topics. I'm already close to the hotspots when I do my daily commentary, and I hope my life can be farther away from the news.\" (Interviewee H) 6.

The main activities in implementing electronic jamming are: first is suppressing the enemy\u2019s air defense systems. One should comprehensively implement jamming with means such as setting up high powered ground jamming stations, employing chaff-carrying aircraft to lay [end of page 179] down a passive jamming corridor, sending a disposable aircraft over the enemy\u2019s radar or on the ground in the vicinity, and applying onboard aircraft electronic jamming equipment; second is jamming the enemy\u2019s satellite positioning systems. Use airborne platform electronic jamming equipment and ground high-powered jamming stations to implement jamming against the enemy\u2019s GPS receivers; third is jamming the enemy\u2019s precision guidance weapons. Deploy electronic jammers in the vicinity of our important targets and overhead the important target areas, release jamming strips $\\{ g a n r a o \\ s i \\}$ , and employ lasers and microwave weapons as well as utilizing aerostat [lighter-than-air] weapons {\u6d6e\u7a7a\u6b66\u5668 fukong wuqi} to implement jamming against the enemy\u2019s raiding missiles; fourth is electronic deception. When organizing the implementation of electronic deception, in accordance with the requirements of campaign deception, deceive the enemy with electronic jamming feint attacks and passive jamming and organize campaign electromagnetic creation of circumstances/momentum {\u6218\u5f79\u7535\u78c1\u9020\u52bf zhanyi dianci zaoshi} to confuse and move the enemy {\u8ff7\u60d1\u8c03\u52a8\u654c\u4eba mihuo diaodong diren}; and conduct this together with deception activities such as campaign camouflage and campaign feints. The joint campaign command and his command organ should, in accordance with the electronic jamming capabilities of each operational group, adopt the method of combining separation by targets {qufen mubiao} and partitioning by areas-zones {huafen $q u y u \\}$ and correctly delegate the jamming missions; flexibly apply a variety of jamming modes such as active or passive jamming, selective {\u7784\u51c6\u5f0f miaozhun shi} jamming or barrage $\\{ z u s e s h i \\}$ jamming and strive to achieve optimum jamming results; concentrate the use of jamming strengths in the important phases, main direction and key point areas, and implement a complete electronic jamming with key points at critical time occasions against the vital site {yaohai} electronic targets of the enemy\u2019s information systems, and thus weakening the integrated-whole effectiveness of their electronic information systems. # 2. Anti-radiation attack {fanfushe gongji} Anti-radiation attack is a type of IO attack form {xingshi} that employs antiradiation weapons (munitions) and utilizes the electromagnetic waves emitted by the enemy\u2019s electronic equipment to track its signals and automatically seek the target and destroy it. Currently, there are mainly two types of anti-radiation weapons: anti-radiation missiles and anti-radiation unmanned aircraft. First is anti-radiation missile attack. The anti-radiation missile is an important information attack means in the future for the PLA\u2019s IO to attack the enemy\u2019s radars and screen our air penetration force-strengths. For aircraft carrying anti-radiation missiles, one normally dispatches attack aircraft {gongji $j i \\}$ , uses unmanned aircraft to lure the enemy\u2019s radars to switch on, and then subsequently measure the enemy\u2019s radar target parameters, [end of page 180], launch the anti-radiation missiles and destroy the enemy\u2019s radars in the direction of our attack so as to open up a safety air corridor for our attack formations {gongji biandui}. They [aircraft carrying anti-radiation missiles] can accompany the attack formation $\\{ g o n g j i b i a n d u i \\}$ , together carry out penetration missions and in destroy in real-time the radar targets that constitute as threats against our air attack formation. Second is the anti-radiation unmanned aircraft attack. The anti-radiation [emanation] unmanned vehicle is a type of unmanned aircraft which utilizes the enemy\u2019s electromagnetic emanation signals as its guidance signal, tracks and destroys its emanation source. After the anti-radiation unmanned aircraft is launched, the ground control station remote-controls the unmanned aerial vehicle to fly towards the designated route; then in accordance with the pre-programmed flight to the enemy\u2019s radar positions, it will orbit overhead and lure the enemy\u2019s radars to switch on; the search device will measure-analyze and identify the enemy\u2019s radar signal, track and destroy the enemy\u2019s radar. If, during the attack process, the enemy radar uses \u201csilent\u201d tactics to counter the anti-radiation unmanned aerial vehicle\u2019s attack, the unmanned aerial vehicle will resume an orbiting flight to await the time-opportunity to re-attack. The joint campaign commander and his command organ, during the course of seizing joint campaign information dominance, command of the air or command of the sea operational activities and the campaign, they should allocate in a unified manner the employment of the anti-radiation strengths within the joint campaign task-organization and thoroughly organize the anti-radiation attack activities. (2) Network attack Network attack refers to the various measures and means of utilizing human designed special computer programs and computer viruses to weaken, disrupt or destroy the enemy\u2019s computer network systems or lower their operating effectiveness. For this, one mainly uses computer network infiltration means and computer virus attack means to transmit to the enemy false information, issue false orders, modify the enemy\u2019s operational documents and data, and harass their operational command. Firstly, implement computer infiltration attack {jisuanji shentou gongji}. One should, in accordance with higher level intent and the operational missions, organize the implementation of uninterrupted surveillance against the target networks; promptly discover the holes and fragile links that utilize the enemy network operating systems, network protocols, application software and management operations as well as [discover] utilize the inter-connection quality of a wide area network and the unbalanced quality of security protection level development; comprehensively apply techniques such as networking, computers, encryption decoding, signals analysis and protocol decoding; adopt modes such as forced penetration or looped infiltration; break through security protection mechanisms such as firewalls, gateways, encrypted authentications; and gain user rights and control privileges against target networks so as to open up passageways for subsequent attacks. Second is implementing network deception harassment. One should, in accordance with higher level intent and the operational missions, utilize the user rights and control privileges one has already grasped for the enemy\u2019s networks, harass the identification authentication mechanisms of their networks, modify their stored secret information, disrupt the integrity and accuracy of their information, interfere with the normal operations of their information systems, issue false situation, false data and false instructions at the right times, and influence and misdirect their command decisionmaking and operational activities. Third is implementing disruptive to paralysis attacks. One should, in accordance with higher level intent and the operational missions, apply modes such as information obstruction, virus insertion, send electronic mail bombs; conduct attacks against the enemy\u2019s networks; expend and disrupt the enemy\u2019s network resources; lower the operating effectiveness of their systems; and cause them to not be able to operate normally and even to be paralyzed. The joint campaign commander and his command organ should, in accordance with the needs-requirements of the joint campaign\u2019s overall situation, actively organize and perform adjusting-coordination for the associated network attack strengths of the armed forces and local areas, and draw support from the nation\u2019s integrated information sources to implement attacks against the important civilian network systems that are involved in operations and hold together war potential, and thus weakening the enemy\u2019s war potential. The joint campaign command and his command organ must tightly center on the campaign intention, and with enemy\u2019s command, control, communications, intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance systems and civilian critical information network as the main attack targets, fully utilize the holes and fragile links within the enemy\u2019s network systems, actively organize activities such as infiltration attacks, deception harassment attacks and disruptive to paralysis attacks. # (3) Special information warfare weapons attack In special information warfare weapons attack, this is mainly using direction finding capable weapons, electromagnetic pulse weapons and electrical network weapons to implement information attacks against the enemy. Direction finding weapon attack is mainly using direction finding weapons to blind or damage the sensors [end of page 182] of the enemy\u2019s electro-optical systems, and interfere with the enemy\u2019s satellite system $\\{ x i n g t i \\}$ , on-satellite equipment, other information systems and main battle weapon platforms with key points and with options. The electromagnetic pulse weapon is mainly using the electromagnetic pulse weapon to implement \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d destruction against the enemy\u2019s electronic equipment and their personnel so as to cause them to lose operational effectiveness. The electrical network weapon is mainly using the electrical network attack weapons to disrupt the enemy\u2019s electrical facilities and electrical supply systems associated with operations. The joint campaign commander and his command organ should fully bring into play the superior merits of special information operational weapons, and in accordance with the different situations of the targets needing to be attacked, they should flexibly apply new concept information warfare weapons against the enemy\u2019s information systems and implement attacks against their operational platforms. (4) Psychological attack Psychological attack is an important means of information attack. Within joint campaign IO, one must fully apply \u201csoft-strike\u201d and \u201chard-strike\u201d means to implement psychological attacks against the enemy so as to create tremendous shock in the enemy psychologically, to put them into a state of fear for a long period of time and to achieve the goal of victory without battle. The important means for implementing psychological attack against the enemy are: first is organizing the implementation of public opinion propagation {yulun xuanchuan}. Regardless of whether it is before the war or during, one must fully utilize vehicles such as leaflets, pictures, broadcasts, television, computer networks, broadcasts [sic], television [sic], audiovisual periodicals {yinxiang baokan}, internet, etc., adopt modes such as afloat on the sea, aerial release, battlefield frontline propaganda, and implement psychological intimidation, psychological leading {xinli youdao} so as to shake the enemy military\u2019s hearts, collapse their morale, divide their antagonistic momentum $\\{ d i d u i s h i l i \\}$ , and strive for the hearts of the enemy\u2019s civilians. Second is applying psychological warfare weapons and implementing psychological attacks against the enemy. One can, through the use of special psychological warfare weapons such as a noise simulator {zaosheng fangzhenqi}, electronic whistles {diazni xiaojiaoqi}, thinking control weapons {siwei kongzhi wuqi}, and virtual reality means, etc., attack and intimidate the enemy, cause the enemy\u2019s military and people to create psychological fear or various delusions {huanjue} and thus shake their will for war and lower their operational capabilities.

(\u0d2d\u372d\u460c\u23a7\u385a\u4600\u1d39\u4c80\u079c\u0a28) operates 59 bulk carriers that ensure steady coal supplies to China Energy Group\u2019s regional power plants.39 Like many other shipping companies, it faces challenges in building ship Party structures because the majority of crew do not belong to the enterprise itself but are instead outsourced to professional crew management companies. Of the 1,397 personnel aboard the fleet, only 85 belong to Guoneng Yuanhai Shipping. Of the 1,397 personnel, 161 are Party members, but only 5 of those actually fall under the company itself. With high turnover rates and low quality among outsourced crew members that have Party membership, it is difficult to equitably distribute these members across the fleet.40 Guoneng Yuanhai Shipping struggles to achieve the three-Party member minimum required to establish Party branches aboard each ship.41 To fix this problem, Guoneng Yuanhai Shipping adopted the \u201cfloating political commissar mechanism\u201d (\u2371\u08d8\u1b6f\u1004\u1d6a\u0866). Beginning in 2019, 8 personnel were chosen from the company\u2019s ranks to serve as these floating ship political commissars. Each were assigned to 5 or 6 vessels and would serve one to two months aboard each, providing political commissar coverage for up to 40 vessels. While aboard, they would conduct Party building work and complete their task lists and evaluation activities. The solution envisions a fleet divided into four groups, each forming a \u201cclustered\u201d Party branch that would incorporate both shore-based managers and the Party members among the ship crews.42 This case demonstrates a compromise between SOE Party building requirements and the challenges of operating under competitive market conditions.

One ship political commissar from the Guangzhou Branch of COSCO Shipping Seafarer Management Co., Ltd., COSCO Shipping\u2019s company dedicated to personnel management, noted in 2022 that some commissars are inadequate in their responsibilities and cannot meet the high expectations set by crews and companies. They lack political awareness and ethics, lack professional skills, are unsuitable role models for crew. This causes poor results in their ideological and political work. Critically, a poor performing political commissar will fail to gain the trust of the crew and captain. They would thus struggle to effectively manage crew members, understand crew issues, and adequately perform their duties on board.43 Some issues in the ship political commissar system stem from contemporary socioeconomic dynamics and a lack of receptiveness by the crew. The PRC\u2019s rapid economic growth has resulted in many youth pursuing other careers ashore, making the merchant mariner life less appealing. They are also less open to the guidance of political commissars. Those youth that do join the seafaring life are difficult for ship political commissars to manage. One political commissar noted that current younger crew members are more difficult to understand and the spread of communication platforms, such as smart phones and social media, has compounded the situation; unlike past generations of ship crews, who were typically more obedient.44 In general, the merchant mariner career in the PRC has declined in its prestige and relative economic standing, resulting in increased skepticism among crews toward the ideological work of political commissars.45 Societal influence and a general lack of clarity on the responsibilities of the ship political commissar has also caused confusion among the commissars themselves. Some ship political commissars have lost their sense of mission and have let ship Party branch discipline slide.46 The ship political commissar career is generally viewed as a dead end with few prospects for advancement, unlike the career trajectory of other ship officers and technical positions. Many political commissars serve their entire careers in the same position, resulting demotivation and poor work performance.47 In addition to poor career prospects, the position has long suffered from obsolescence. The political functions of the role and standing among the crew has weakened. Previous reductions in political and ideological work for the sake of supporting the commercial operations of companies, the inability to adapt Party ideology to maintain relevance for modern crews, and the increasing technological sophistication of shipping has likely further diluted the importance of ship political commissars.48 In some cases, ship political commissars may resort to filing reports to impress their company superiors.49 To improve their relevance, one expert recommends strengthening their sense of mission, enhancing their status as role models in morality and ethics for the crew, asserting greater discipline, and continuing implementation of company training programs for political commissars.50 These are hardly innovative solutions to issues that have persisted for decades. 43 Wang Caihua, pp. 45-47. 44 \u3110\u25fc\u5138\u2357\u3664\u3d8f\u1d0c\u5cb2: 80%\u5129\u3720\u3ad4\u1d19\u441e\u2ce4\u1e5b5 \u2d73\u230d\u48ba\u2dff [\u201cThe Sources of China\u2019s Seafarers are Insufficient: 80% of Navigation School Graduates Leave After 5 Years On the Job\u201d], \u34af\u224d\u483d-\u46ac\u361a\u1d1b\u34b8\u2367\u2109 [Xinhua \u2013 Oriental Outlook], 7 July 2014, https://finance.sina.cn/chanjing/gdxw/2014-07-07/detail-icesifvw9409848.d.html?from=wap. 45 Shi Qinghe and Ma Yunqin, p. 35. 46 Shi Qinghe and Ma Yunqin, p. 35; Wang Caihua, pp. 45-47. 47 Ibid, p. 35. 48 Wang Caihua, pp. 45-47. 49 Zhao Minghua, Shi Xiuyin, and Feng Tongqing, p. 183. 50 Wang Caihua, pp. 45-47. 10 In 2015, experts with direct knowledge of training ship political commissars published an article that argued for potential solutions. They called for greater clarification and definition of the ship political commissar\u2019s roles and responsibilities to fix the issue of the position being maintained for the purpose of having the position, rather than the actual utility and qualification of a political commissar. Instead of having political commissars fulfill numerous roles on board each ship, they should focus on their core mission as a Party representative and political worker on board. They should be evaluated accordingly and ship captains should exercise greater patience and support them. Professional training should be strengthened at merchant marine training institutes in conjunction with a formal and standardized certification process as well as a more robust evaluation system. Interestingly, they recommended the creation of a rank system for political commissars that would incentivize current commissars to work harder and promote the position to new seafarers.51 This further highlighted the reality of ship political commissar as a career track with low expectations for future growth. A Revitalization of Ship Political Commissars in COSCO Shipping The PRC\u2019s economic development since it opened to trade and investment gradually culminated in a broad alignment of national interests that would lead Hu Jintao to announce a strategy to become a maritime power during the 18th Party Congress. 52 This strategy would accelerate under Xi Jinping through stronger emphasis on the merchant fleets carrying inputs and outputs globally, the merchant fleets. The State Council\u2019s issuance of \u201cOpinions of the State Council on Promoting the Sound Development of the Shipping Industry\u201d in 2014 set forth the importance of the national shipping industry for social and economic development and outlined a number of reforms to strengthen its structure and international competitiveness. These opinions noted the overarching goal of development was to build the PRC into a \u201cpowerful shipping country\u201d (\u23a7\u4600\u156a\u0d2d).53 Subsequent official documents and announcements, including the State Council\u2019s release of \u201cThe Outline for Building a Powerful Transportation Nation\u201d and the cross-governmental issuance of the \u201cGuiding Opinions on Vigorously Promoting High-Quality Development of the Shipping Industry\u201d would further highlight the sector\u2019s importance. Xi himself declared that the shipping industry would be the top priority.54 With this consistent top-level guidance, the PRC has worked to improve the overall structure and operations of the shipping industry, with state-owned shipping giant COSCO leading the way. 51 Shi Qinghe and Ma Yunqin, p. 35. 52 \u4fe0\u6425\u3c9a\u2627\u1d2c\u25fc\u2070\u1da6\u2059\u4a2b\u2240\u206a\u3a20\u2067\u25fc\u1de2\u5767\u2826\u1e19\u1d09\u4583\u31a4\u2349 [\u201cHu Jintao\u2019s Report to the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China\u201d], \u34af\u224d\u483d [Xinhua], 17 November 2012, https://www.gov.cn/ldhd/2012- 11/17/content_2268826.htm. 53 Key tasks outlined included optimizing the structure of the shipping fleet, promoting mergers and consolidation to build scale, deepen the reform and development of state-owned shipping, and other measures.", "metadata": "Kennedy - CMSI 40 - Onboard Political Control (2024).pdf", "judgement": true}, "18": {"text": "However, judging from the later situation, there are still some areas that need to be revised and supplemented. . For this reason, the author published the book \"Building a Study for National Security\u2014The Exploration Process of National Security Discipline and Research on Some Issues\" published in 2014, which explored some new issues in the discipline construction of national security studies and made the theoretical system of national security studies more complete. , also raises the issue of the subject status of the national security discipline. 2019.04 Higher education However, this cautious view on the status of the national security discipline has been outdated in the overall national security strategy layout of the party and government in my country in recent years. With the establishment of the National Security Council, the introduction of the overall national security concept, the promulgation of the \"National Security Strategy Outline\" and the continuous advancement of national security legal construction, the issue of national security education and national security discipline construction in our country has also been put on the forefront. In terms of its increasingly important strategic position, the construction of \"a first-level discipline of national security studies\" is clearly recorded in the documents of the Ministry of Education. The \"National Security Law of the People's Republic of China\", promulgated and implemented on July 1, 2015, stipulates that \"April 15 every year is the National Security Education Day for All People\", and also stipulates that \"incorporating national security education into the national education system and civil servant education and training system \". On April 15, 2016, the eve of the first National Security Education Day, General Secretary Xi Jinping instructed: \"We must take the establishment of the National Security Education Day as an opportunity, and under the guidance of the overall national security concept, fully implement the National Security Law and carry out in-depth National security publicity and education, and effectively enhance the national security awareness of the whole people.\" On April 14, 2016, the General Office of the Ministry of Education issued a notice requiring teachers and students to generally master national security knowledge, enhance national security awareness, and consciously maintain national security. On April 9, 2018, the Ministry of Education issued the \"Implementation Opinions on Strengthening National Security Education in Universities and Primary Schools\", pointing out the necessity and importance of carrying out national security education in universities, middle schools and primary schools, and giving national security education to universities, middle schools and primary schools from multiple levels. Safety education has made deployment arrangements, one of which is to \"promote the construction of national security disciplines\" and \"establish a first-level discipline of national security studies\". The Subject Status and Content of National Security Studies In my country's current catalog of higher education majors, there is a subject category called \"Military Science\". If the discipline of national security is established, then this discipline must include military security and broader military issues. This is because, in reality and in essence, the military is an issue of national security, an important means of safeguarding national security, an important content of national security, and an important part of the national security system. with real military Not long after the concept of \"National Security Studies\" was proposed, the author decided that National Security Studies is not only the name of a discipline, but also a general term for a category of disciplines. Later, in the article \"National Security Science is the Unity of National Security Science and National Security Philosophy\", the author mentioned \": As the name of a discipline,  'National Security Science' is one of the 'National Security Sciences' It is a basic and general subject, so it can be more accurately named as 'Principles of National Security Science' or 'Basic Principles of National Security Science'. As the name of a class of disciplines, 'National Security Science' includes many specific national security sciences , such as domestic security, international security, national political security, national military security,  national economic security, national security intelligence, national security anti-espionage,  national security strategy, national security law, etc. It is more accurate to call it 'national security discipline' or 'national security discipline'. \"[10] Obviously, the author here has two ideas on the status of national security discipline: One is that national security discipline can be \"First- level discipline\"; the second is that the national security discipline can become a \"discipline category\". After the document of the Ministry of Education proposed \"the establishment of a first-level discipline of national security studies\", some universities held a seminar on the construction of a first-level discipline of national security studies. Scholars put forward some different ideas on how to build a first-level discipline of national security studies. Some scholars agree with the author\u2019s previous point of view, and believe that the first-level discipline of national security should be set under the category of \u201claw science\u201d, and some scholars believe that the first-level discipline of national security should be set under the category of \u201cmanagement science\u201d. It was during this discussion that I thought over and over again based on the basic content and viewpoints of the overall national security concept, and felt more and more that today, when the overall national security concept has been put forward, the study of national security should not be just a first-level discipline, but should be become a discipline.

Focus on this issue In the future, the subject of national security can be officially included in the catalog of higher education in my country as a subject category, so that more colleges and universities can justifiably recruit students majoring in national security, and also enable graduates majoring in national security to obtain better employment opportunities, and ultimately provide better talent guarantee and knowledge services for my country's national security.

Higher education (Author Unit: Department of Public Administration, School of International Relations)  [Responsible Editor: Yu Yang] References: National Security Studies is a social science theory with Chinese characteristics pioneered by the School of International Relations. In the construction of the national security discipline system, the School of International Relations has always been at the forefront of the times. After passing the audit of the Ministry of Education in 2017, the School of International Relations has recruited the first batch of graduate students majoring in national security in 2018. In addition, the School of International Relations is also preparing to recruit undergraduates majoring in national security in 2019. When conditions permit, doctoral students majoring in national security will also be recruited. We hope that in the near future As mentioned above, there are many first-level disciplines under the category of national security science, some of which are relatively mature, such as military science, police science, diplomacy, etc., and some have some preliminary results in recent years, such as national security principles, national security management Studies of national security law, national security strategy, non-traditional security studies, etc., and some need to further establish a relatively complete theoretical system on the basis of previous research results, such as information science, frontier studies, etc. At the same time, under non-traditional security studies, non-traditional security majors such as anti-terrorism studies, national information security management, national ecological security studies, and national cultural security studies can be set up. The reason why national security disciplines have such rich content and so many first-level disciplines and second- level disciplines need to be established is determined by the richness of contemporary national security reality. It belongs to the category of national security, and national security includes military adaptation. In terms of discipline relationship, military science cannot be absent from the national security discipline system, and military science should not be outside the national security discipline system. That is to say, in terms of the logical relationship of disciplines, military science can only be subordinate to national security studies, and national security studies must be placed above military science. To this end, the category of \"Military Science\" in the current professional catalog can be replaced with \"National Security\",  put \"Military Science\" as a first-level subject under the category of \"National Security\", and renamed it \"Military Science\" \". While downgrading \"Military Science\" to a first-level discipline and changing its name to \"Military Science\", it is also necessary to include the first-level discipline of \"Public Security Science\" that used to be under the category of \"Law Science\" into the category of \"National Security Science\", and Renamed to the more general \"police science\". In addition, \"Diplomatics\", which is in the first-level discipline of \"Political Science\", also needs to be included in the category of \"National Security\" and upgraded to a first-level discipline. This is because, regardless of the military, police, and diplomacy, their main function is to ensure national security, and they are all important forces to ensure national security. In this way, the first-level disciplines under the national security category include not only national security principles, national security management, national security law, and national security strategy as basic theories, but also military science as an important aspect of national security. Science, police science, intelligence, diplomacy, etc., as well as the new non-traditional security studies, frontier studies, etc. This article is funded by the National Key Research and Development Program \"Research and Application of Key Technologies for National Security Risk Management\" (Project No. :  2018YFC0806900), and the Key Project of Innovation Team Building of the School of International Relations \"Research on the Deepening and Perfection of National Security Principles\" (Project No. : 3262018T01) phased research results", "metadata": "The History and New Thinking of National Security Studies Discipline Construction_Liu Yuejin_EN.pdf", "judgement": true}, "19": {"text": "In addition, not all would agree with Schweller\u2019s position that Waltzian neorealism remains a foundational baseline for neoclassical realism. One group of scholars has recently raised the possibility that recurring balance of power dynamics may be confined to \u2018\u2018modern Europe and its global successor.\u2019\u2019 Their work covers eight case studies spanning different periods and regions, from ancient Greece to the Americas. They conclude that \u2018\u2018both systemic outcomes and state behavior directly contradict the core balance-of-power hypothesis that balancing behavior prevents systemic hegemony.\u2019\u2019 As a result of their research, these scholars question the common practice of endeavoring to solve puzzles related to the failure of some states to conform to balance of power behavior, because the \u2018\u2018evidence fatally undermines the widespread belief that balancing is a universal empirical law in multistate systems and the equally pervasive tendency to assign explanatory precedence to balance-of-power theory\u2019\u2019 . Others have argued that during the Cold War, the United States sought a position of power preponderance and the creation of a free trade regime as a result of its leaders\u2019 experience of the collapse of free trade and the rise of totalitarianism prior to the Second World War. Its leaders sought to preserve liberalism at home by producing an international environment conducive to its continuance. According to Melvyn Leffler, the United States sought an open inter national economic order so that a recurrence of such events would not happen and ensure the maintenance of US preponderance thus preventing a move away from liberalism toward a garrison state at home. In addition, some writers question the explanatory potential of the theory in the contemporary era, arguing that unipolarity is a \u2018\u2018deeply embedded material condition of world politics that has the potential to last for many decades\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018Analysts would be wise to invest their talents in investigating the novel dynamics of great-power bargaining in today\u2019s unipolar system rather than seeking to stretch old analytical concepts that were created to deal with the bipolar and multipolar systems of the past\u2019\u2019 . Other recent work by neoclassical realists is quite explicit that state behavior is not necessarily determined by the international environment. Rather anarchy is viewed as a permissive condition and thus \u2018\u2018Since anarchy and polarity do not determine the actions of states (as acknowledged by structural realists as well), neo- and post classical realists argue that we need to incorporate other variables as well\u2019\u2019 . Christopher Layne, for example, argues that the United States\u2019 \u2018\u2018pursuit of hegemony in regions outside the Western Hemisphere is primarily driven by Open Door\u2014domestic\u2014considerations and is not structurally determined.\u2019\u2019 The explanation for the United States\u2019 pursuit of extra regional hegemony can be found not at the international, but at the domestic level. Furthermore, a policy of extra regional hegemony stands in sharp contrast to the behavior predicted by defensive realism (no hegemony) and by Mearsheimer\u2019s offensive realism (regional hegemony). Both predict that the United States should be engaging in offshore balancing, but Layne argues that the United States has sought to establish extra regional hegemony and actively prevented other states 'regions emerging as new autonomous poles of power. Moreover, the force behind such dominance has been the desire to project the liberal political and economic conditions found at home upwards to the inter national level, endeavoring to create an \u2018\u2018\u2018Open Door World\u2019\u2014an international system, or \u2018world order,\u2019 made up of states that are open and subscribe to the United States\u2019 liberal values and institutions and that are open to US economic penetration\u2019\u2019 . This new generation of writers views neoclassical realism as a distinctive syn thesis combining both external and internal factors in order to explain state behavior. Jeffrey Taliaferro, for example, has produced a balance of risk theory incorporating a psychological model of decision making (prospect theory). Based upon experimental evidence, the model posits that \u2018\u2018most individuals tend to evaluate choices with respect to an expectation level and pay more attention to losses than to comparable gains. They also tend to overweight certain outcomes relative to probable ones; value what they already possess over what they seek to acquire; and display risk-acceptant behavior to avoid (or recoup) losses, but risk-averse behavior to secure gains.\u2019\u2019 The theory thus furnishes defensive realism with a strong foundation in human psychological traits, explaining the status-quo bias of states by examining the way in which \u2018\u2018leaders process information about the international environment and their position relative to that of other states\u2019\u2019. The theory also explains how state leaders fall victim to entrapment in the periphery and engage in escalating commitment despite previous setbacks and future risks. According to the theory, \u2018\u2018Leaders who initially intervened to avert losses in their state\u2019s relative power or international status will be quite reluctant to reassess, let alone reverse, strategies that fail to produce desired results\u2026.Loss aversion drives central decision makers not only to persist in failing strategies, but also to take additional risks in the hope of recouping their initial investment\u2019\u2019. Steven Lobell examines the dilemma that confronts a hegemon in decline. The hegemon has to deal with keeping allies (which may include future contenders) on side and at the same time deal with rising regional powers. Lobell therefore investigates \u2018\u2018how a declining hegemon selects which states to punish, where to cooperate, and how to allocate its national resources between its productive capacity and military security.\u2019\u2019 Such decision making, he argues, is explained by a second image reversed plus a second image\u2014the foreign policy of the hegemon will not be shaped simply by the number and size of rising con tenders. Rather, the political \u2044 economic constitutions of these contenders will have an impact upon political coalitions within the hegemon itself which will in turn affect the direction of foreign policy. If it is confronted by \u2018\u2018mostly liberal contenders, this will strengthen members of the free-trade faction who will push for cooperation ...[I]f the hegemon encounters mostly imperial contenders, this will enable constituents of the economic nationalist coalition who will lobby for punishment\u2019\u2019. Indeed, Lobell argues that, the strength of this influence is such that \u2018\u2018the hegemon\u2019s grand strategy is driven less by the concern for relative gains, the reputation for predation, or the strategic value of the locale, than by its international environment and the domestic coalitional outcomes.\u2019\u2019 Norrin Ripsman not only challenges the assumption that all democracies behave the same way at the international level, thus questioning one of the main premises of democratic peace theory, but also challenges neorealist assumptions that policymakers can simply follow their own preferences and that the outcomes of international negotiations will always reflect the distribution of power. Clearly, the historical record indicates that when dealing with international issues, the leaders of democracies have enjoyed varying degrees of freedom and this has largely been dependent upon the internal democratic structure and processes of each state. In a series of empirical studies, Ripsman demonstrates that less constraining domestic environments allow leaders to \u2018\u2018construct foreign security policies that are consistent with their own preferences, even when they face domestic opposition.\u2019\u2019 Those leaders that do confront constrictive domestic constraints will find that policy options will be limited by domestic opposition. However, they will be able to play this card when dealing with officials of other states thus strengthening their negotiating hand at the international level and increasing the likelihood that their preferred policy option succeeds. In addition, the level of autonomy a leader possesses will also depend upon the use of deception: when state leaders find domestic constraints too great\u2014they may increase their room to maneuver by being rather economical with the truth when reporting to their domestic assemblies. This new generation emphasizes that, unlike Waltzian neorealism which seeks to explain the constancy in state behavior across millennia, neoclassical realism seeks to explain why states behave differently in similar situations. Rather than identifying core transhistorical and transcultural patterns of behavior, these scholars seek to \u2018\u2018explain variation in the foreign policies of individual states over time or of different states when confronted with similar external constraints'\u2019 . In relation to the first generation of neoclassical realism, Stephen Walt has commented that \u2018\u2018it relies almost entirely on theoretical arguments by others and has yet to offer a distinct set of explanatory hypotheses of its own.\u2019\u2019 Whether this was indeed true of earlier writings is itself debatable, but it is clear that the new generation of scholars have risen to this challenge developing theories of foreign policy that are clearly different to, and separate from, Waltzian neorealism. They do still emphasize the importance of the international structure and distribution of power, but they locate \u2018\u2018causal properties at both the structural and unit levels, the unit-level factors help to explain state external behavior\u2019\u2019. In addition, most writers have made \u2018\u2018conscious efforts to derive testable hypotheses, specify the predictions or observable implications of those hypotheses, and finally to test the relative explanatory power of neoclassical realist and alternative hypotheses against empirical evidence\u2019\u2019. Most significantly more recent work by these scholars has sought to establish under what conditions their theories are most likely to apply. By using two major aspects of the international system that vary over time (clarity of the international system regarding threats\u2026and the degree of information it provides on how best to respond to these structural conditions), they have clarified the degree of relevancy of their approach in any given situation. Their approach is most relevant when two environments pertain. First when threats are clear and the policy responses are self evident. In this case, neoclassical realism can explain why states did not pursue the most obvious course of action. Second, when threats and opportunities are obvious but the international environment provides little in the way of information on the most appropriate response. In this situation, domestic factors play a far more important role in determining which policies the state ultimately chooses. As one author has commented, the \u2018\u2018greatest achievement of post- and neoclassical realism is that they enable us to make predictions about specific states and explain why they acted in a particular way\u2019\u2019 . The obvious success of neoclassical realism in applying itself to a range of case studies will ensure that this body of literature will grow both in volume and popularity. As was mentioned in the Introduction, some strategic culturalists are now arguing that potential exists for research collaboration between realists and strategic culturalists. But such a proposal may assume greater coherency within the strategic culture school of research than actually exists currently. For example, Alastair Iain Johnston identified three waves of strategic culture research: the first relating to cultural analysis of United States\u2013Soviet Union relationships in the late 1970s; the second associated with writing on the instrumentality of culture in the 1980s; and the third pertaining to a more eclectic discussion of organizational and societal cultural analysis. Subsequent attempts to chronicle the evolution of strategic culture research have offered variations on Johnston\u2019s original thesis. However, rather than adopting a temporal approach, this paper develops four conceptions of strategic culture. This does not imply that these other alternatives are not valid, nor does it imply the existence of only four conceptions. Rather, the division has been adopted in order to highlight the ramifications for those seeking to pursue a strategic culture research program and the possibility of engagement with neoclassical realism. In developing these conceptions, the paper makes a Rawlsian distinction between concept and conceptions. In other words, although interpretations of strategic culture abound, there is an overlap between them (the concept) to the extent that we can identify a core concept. This paper thus takes a general definition that can be applied to all four conceptions. Strategic culture is viewed here as a set of shared beliefs, and assumptions derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which influence the appropriate ends and means chosen for achieving security objectives. However, the articulation of this definition will vary according to the conception under consideration. For example, the four core conceptions of strategic culture identified are: epiphenomenal strategic culture; a conventional constructivist conception; a post-structuralist conception and an interpretive conception. But for both realism and epiphenomenal strategic culture, the influence of strategic culture is viewed as merely inducing short-term aberrant behavior to that which otherwise would be expected in any given international environment. Constructivists, on the other hand view these shared beliefs and assumptions as constituting various aspects of strategic practices. Interpretivists, along with many constructivists, would argue that these beliefs and assumptions lead to state leaders developing a certain weltanschauung of the social environment (of which the international is a subcategory) in which their states reside so that culture has an overriding influence upon their view of all events and how they should respond. Meanwhile, post-structuralists view culture in terms of discourse and, as such, highly malleable to the interjection of social agents. In this case, strategic culture not only influences the appropriate ends and means to be used (as stated in the definition) but may be manipulated in order to achieve the ends desired by social agents in order to achieve a particular foreign policy outcome.", "metadata": "glenn- strategic culture&realism-cl.txt", "judgement": true}, "20": {"text": "Indeed, the \u201cApril Youth Club\u201d who protested against CNN\u2019s representation of the \u201cOlympic flame incident\u201d in Tibet in 2008, is representative of this:  those who were ideologically promoting China\u2019s rise and challenging the American hegemonic order were none other than successive generations of Chinese youth who had studied in the United States. Hence, in Huntington\u2019s view, at the end of the Cold War, the world did not move toward an \u201cend of history\u201d dominated by the American lifestyle, but instead toward a \u201cclash of civilizations.\u201d  In his view, in addition to the clash between Christian and Islamic civilizations, there is also the clash between Christian and Chinese Confucian civilizations. Since the May Fourth movement, the Chinese elite has identified with Western culture and values, be it American-European capitalist culture or the socialist culture of the USSR. Yet as China\u2019s political stability and economic flourishing have stimulated China\u2019s rise, the Chinese people have gradually bid farewell to ideas of full-scale Westernization in cultural matters, and pay little attention to ideological differences between capitalism and socialism. Instead, they are actively indigenizing Western culture and returning to China\u2019s own history and traditions, which explains growing feelings of national pride and cultural self-confidence. We can see this not only in the wave of \u201cnational studies \u56fd\u5b66\u70ed\u201d at the grass roots level, but also in the vibrant rise of cultural conservatism among China\u2019s elites. Even more important, the new generation of political leadership places even more emphasis on reviving China\u2019s cultural traditions. The 18th NPC promoted \u201cself-confidence in our path, in our theory, and in our system,\u201d and the 19th NPC made a critical addition\u2014\u201ccultural self-confidence.\u201d  If the first three express differences between the path taken by China\u2019s system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and that taken by Western capitalism, the final self-confidence speaks to the revival of Chinese civilization and traditions. For this reason, when Trump visited Beijing in the period before the Sino-American trade war, what he and General Secretary Xi Jinping chatted about in the Forbidden City was the uninterrupted history of 5,000 years of Chinese civilization. This means that while China can accept the market economy, democratic politics, cultural freedom and other concepts grounded in the Western cultural tradition, China absolutely cannot take the path of Western capitalism, nor reproduce American lifestyles, but will instead follow China\u2019s own path to modernity shaped by Chinese history and civilization. This is also the political significance of the Chinese government\u2019s consistent emphasis on \u201cthe path of socialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d and \u201cthe revival of the great Chinese nation.\u201d  Only when China and America, two great powers, have arrived at mutual equality and respect in terms of cultural, history, and traditions, in terms of paths of political development, and in terms of ideology, can the Sino-American relationship find the right track and establish a new-style great power relationship. For this reason, in post-Cold War history, any strong nation, or any nation attempting to build a strong government, must openly or implicitly become a country that \u201ccan say no to America.\u201d  This is true for Russia, as well as for China, Iran, Turkey, North Korea, it was true for the former Iraq and the former Libya, and it is true as well for Merkel\u2019s Germany and Macron\u2019s France. This is less because the entire world has entered a period of \u201cstrong governments\u201d and more because the world has entered what the journalist Fareed Zakaria has called the \u201cpost-American\u201d era. And rather than see these as political choices made by political strongmen, we should instead see them as the product of the internal logic of global political history, in other words, that \"deep globalization\" has promoted the formation of a community of common destiny for all mankind that will stand together through thick and thin. A new type of international order must be constructed on the basis of mutual respect, and opposing the United States\u2019 construction of a world empire based on the Western imperialist tradition must be the common mission of all mankind. For this reason, even before the completion of American\u2019s new Roman Empire, the project has faced resistance and opposition from all the world\u2019s great powers, including China. The path the United States is taking today is actually recreating the path taken by the Soviet Union in the Brezhnev era in an effort to establish world hegemony. This is why the Singaporean diplomat Kishore Mahbubani (b. 1948) said that the United States today acts in the world like the Soviet Union did back then, while China acts in the world like the United States did. [19] Conclusion Today, most observers of Sino-American relations are pessimistic, believing that things will only get worse. But this pessimism is due precisely to the presuppositions of an overly blindly optimistic vision of Sino-U.S. relations in the past few decades, in other words, the argument that China would gradually, in the process of international engagement, fall in line with the American-built world empire. In a sense, this optimistic imagination also presupposes the normative premise of the end of history. However, if we reflect a bit on this normative premise, we will realize that such optimism was but a brief historical moment. Over the long course of history, China has always been a world power that handles its affairs independently and chooses its own path of development. When the New China began its national reconstruction, she did not hesitate to face the suppression of the two world superpowers, the U.S. and the USSR, while at the same time exploring its own development path. Today, against the backdrop of China\u2019s rise, it is all the more impossible to submit to the world imperial order unilaterally imposed on China by the United States. Even more important, solely from a geopolitical perspective, should China submit to the strategic arrangements of the American world empire, this would mean that China would find herself on the front lines of the American conquest of Russia, the Middle East, and the Islamic world. This clearly is not in China\u2019s national interests, and China's location in the middle of Eurasia and the Pacific world dictates that it must construct its own geopolitical world. In reality, in the absence of the background of the Cold War, the global revival of market economies jointly promoted by Reagan, Thatcher, and Deng Xiaoping would have been difficult; and in the absence of the global changes created by 9-11, the comprehensive economic cooperation between China and the United States would have been impossible. Of course, in the absence of China\u2019s rise, or of China\u2019s strong leadership since the 18th NPC and this leadership\u2019s decision to remain faithful to China\u2019s own path, there might not have been the U.S.-China trade war, or the trade war might have had another solution. Nonetheless, behind these random historical events there remains one unchanging historical question:  will the future global order be the vision of the new Roman Empire, as imagined by the United States? Or rather the vision of the common development of plural civilizations as imagined by the United Nations? Or perhaps a new world order that will evolve out of the tradition of Chinese universalism \u5929\u4e0b\u4e3b\u4e49? [20]  What are the prospects of China\u2019s rise and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation for the future global order? Only by reflecting on and constructing an image of the future can Sino-U.S. relations arrive at a proper repositioning. In this sense, we have reason to remain optimistic about current Sino-American conflicts and the future of Sino-American relations, in the sense that this relationship will no longer be that of a tortured global posture of mutual cooperation brought about by the Cold War and 9-11, but instead the search for the direction of the historical development their competition will take. Such a contest could spiral out of control and lead to full-scale conflict or even war, but it is also possible to find a line that cannot be crossed line in the contest and to seek cooperation on the basis of that line. \u201cTo seek unity in struggle\u201d requires from both parties dispassionate political judgment and profound political wisdom. As for the United States, perhaps they should abandon their ideology of the \u201cend of history,\u201d abandon their dream of peaceful evolution for China, and let it seek out its own developmental path based on its own traditions, all of which means that perhaps American should rethink its plans to build a new Roman Empire, and sincerely treat China as an equal partner, seeking to cooperate even as we struggle, and in this way approaching China\u2019s proposition that they create a \u201cnew great power relationship.\u201d  This would perhaps means that competition and cooperation between the two countries would become normal, and that their competition would in effect stimulate the dynamism found in both countries, and the cooperation would resolve problems that neither country can solve alone, especially global problems. In fact, the \u201cUnited States Strategic Approach to the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d Report recently issued by the U.S. State Department already reveals this type of thinking, when it states that:  \u201cUnited States policies are not premised on an attempt to change the PRC\u2019s domestic governance model\u2026 Whether the PRC eventually converges with the principles of the free and open order can only be determined by the Chinese people themselves. We recognize that Beijing, not Washington, has agency over and responsibility for the PRC government\u2019s actions.\u201d[21] At least on paper, this suggests that America has abandoned her peaceful evolution strategy for China. This is surely a partial result of the \u201cnew great struggle\u201d actively launched by China over the course of the past crucial decade, in the sense that even while the U.S. declares that there are fundamental differences of principle in Sino-American relations, nonetheless the American \u201crealistic\u201d standpoint respects the fact that the Chinese people choose the system of governance in their country, and decides to treat China as a \u201ccompeting great power.\u201d  Based precisely on this standpoint of \u201cprincipled realism,\u201d even as America competes with China and carries out comprehensive containment of China, it does not exclude the possibility of cooperating with China on the basis of American interests. As for China, perhaps we too should adopt a standpoint of \u201cprincipled realism,\u201d admitting that even as we uphold the principle of the \u201ccommunity of common destiny,\u201d we remain clearly aware of our differences with the West in terms of social and cultural values, nonetheless upholding the rational position of \"realism\" and taking a calm look at ourselves and the whole world we have to face. We must recognize that the basic framework of the current world order has been established by the West over the last few centuries, and a world governed by rules can create a world where human beings work together on the foundation of different cultural traditions. If China wants to actively participate in world governance, she must first seriously study and absorb the positive elements of the world created by the West, and on the basis of this global framework engage in global cooperation. We should also clearly understand that the \u201cpost-American era\u201d will necessarily be an era of conflict and confusion, in which China will have to rely on the cooperation of all world powers and a friendly system of relations with neighbors to solve the problems that might emerge. In the few years of the post-Cold War era, the American ambition to build a world empire has been tragically thwarted, largely due to its blind sense of mission concerning \"the end of history\" and its \"false virtue\" of saving mankind, which led to its ambition exceeding its strength. If the disintegration of the Soviet Union was one lesson for China, allowing China to maintain a clearheaded political consciousness throughout, then America\u2019s decline is another lesson, counseling China to always exercise strategic restraint, overcome the cultural vanity of saving the world, and to maintain constant strategic focus on nation-building, constantly increasing its power, both hard and soft. Because in a world of international competition, \u201cpower is the hard truth.\u201d But if we want to increase national power, then we must think about how to modernize our country\u2019s governance, how to build an organically vibrant society that provides stimulation to life and creativity, how to build a country governed by rules and laws, all of this to meet the increasing global competition for technology, talent, institutions, and civilization. Whether it is the disintegration of the Soviet Union or the decline of the United States, the decisive factors are always internal, which means that the result of future Sino-American competition will basically be determined by domestic affairs in China. Over the critical decade that has influenced the course of Sino-American relations, China has consistently focused on domestic affairs, promoting economic development while always focusing on poverty reduction, and promoting the internal unity and rapid rise of Chinese society, which has given it the strength and ability to face the challenges of the United States. In comparison, the U.S. has neglected domestic affairs. With financial and high-tech oligarchs plundering the nation\u2019s wealth, with manufacturing hollowing out, and with a widening gap between rich and poor, it is not surprising that we see the rise of  a Trump-style oligarchy combining populism and financial domination.", "metadata": "Jiang Shigong 10 Crucial Years PRC Views US Policy Changes.docx", "judgement": true}, "21": {"text": "On 16 June 1982, the Israeli military entered Lebanon. The Soviet Union\u2019s Cosmos-1370 satellite was adjusted two days later to a position where it could observe this gradually escalating war. Based on a similar goal, the Soviet Union\u2019s Cosmos-1377 satellite also flew through the space above the Middle East region from 12 to 16 June, and it transmitted the intelligence that it obtained to Syria and other countries, which had no way to conduct aerial and space reconnaissance, so that they could resist Israel. On 1 November 1982, Iraq launched a new attack against Iran. Soviet spy satellites were quickly turned toward the space above this region. When Cosmos-1419 flew past the battlefield on 5 November, it slowed down, and for the next two days continued to reconnoiter. Cosmos-1421 also continually paid attention to every move and every action in the Persian Gulf, providing intelligence about the combatant countries. 4. The use of space operations in the British-Argentine Falkland Islands War On 4 March 1982, the Falkland Islands War, which caught the world\u2019s attention, broke out between the United Kingdom and Argentina; the start of the war originated in Argentina\u2019s desire to take back the Falkland Islands from the hands of the British. The British, on the other hand, wanted to recover these islands, which had just been occupied by Argentina. In the background of this war, the United States and the Soviet Union staged an intense space intelligence battle. US relations with the United Kingdom were close, and intelligence from satellite reconnaissance naturally was provided to the United Kingdom. And when the United States sanctioned exports of cereals to the Soviet Union, Argentina sold cereals to the Soviet Union, so that it could be seen that the SovietArgentine relationship was not an ordinary one; in order to thank Argentina for its timely assistance, the Soviet Union used intelligence from satellite reconnaissance as a repayment. After the Falkland Islands War broke out, the Soviet Union launched thirteen spy satellites, one after the other; eight of these were radar satellites and five were communications satellites. [The Soviets] primarily used the Cosmos-1347 satellite to carry out reconnaissance and to obtain military intelligence about the British forces. From the departure of the British task force from Portsmouth Harbor straight through to its arrival at the Falkland Islands, Soviet satellites continually closely tracked and monitored it. Afterwards, the Soviet Union also launched military satellites; among them, Cosmos1352 was especially for use in the Falkland Islands War. At the same time that it supplied the Argentine military with intelligence, the Soviets also did not forget their own country\u2019s interests. On 2 April 1982, the British forces were about to land on the Falkland Islands; that day, the Soviet Union launched the Cosmos1347 satellite, in order to reconnoiter how the war was progressing. This satellite was a high-resolution reconnaissance satellite, and it twice flew past the area where the British task force was stationed \u2013 Portsmouth Harbor. After two days, when the main forces of the task force had already completed their preparations for war, and when they were going to put to sea the next morning, this satellite again flew over Portsmouth Harbor, with the goal of wanting to clarify whether or not, as many people at that time had guessed, there was a nuclear submarine in the fleet, and in order to make it easy to provide a military service to the Soviet military and the Warsaw Pact countries. In regard to this, the United States was unwilling to show weakness. At this time, the United States used twenty-four maritime surveillance satellites to provide intelligence support to the United Kingdom and to assist the United Kingdom in sinking Argentina\u2019s cruiser General Belgrado. The Soviet Union used thirty-seven reconnaissance satellites to provide information support for Argentina; the Argentine air force utilized intelligence information provided by Soviet reconnaissance satellites to use an Exocet missile to unexpectedly sink a fairly advanced British missile cruiser [sic], the Sheffield. The Falkland Islands War ultimately came to an end, with Argentina losing because of a great disparity in actual military strengths, but the US-Soviet space battle still continued. # II. The practical applications of space operations in the middle period...191 The several local wars since 1991 have exhibited a great many characteristics that differ from previous wars, so that the shape of war is silently undergoing fundamental and comprehensive changes. Of these, the change that has most caught people\u2019s attention is that military applications in the space sphere have already developed to a brand-new stage; space strengths have begun to comprehensively get involved in local wars, forming a new form of operations. 1. Applications of space operations in the Gulf War The 1991 Gulf War was a classic example of high-tech local warfare, as well as a landmark example where space operations were used to initially form combat strengths. The multinational force headed by the United States, in order to gain victory in the war, made use of space strengths that had become rudimentarily mature in order to provide support-style operations throughout the entire course [of the war], using more than seventy satellites, 118 mobile satellite ground stations, twelve commercial satellite terminals, eighty-one satellite information switches, 329 telephone circuits, thirty message circuits, 30,000 radio frequencies, and 40,000 computers to establish a huge space information collection, transmission, processing, and distribution system. For the first time, it showed the world the powerful information support capability of space strengths, and it had an enormous impact on the course of the war and made important contributions to victory in the Gulf War. After the war, when the US military summarized its experience in the Gulf War, it believed that speaking in a certain sense, the Gulf War was \u201cthe first space war\u201d in human history, and that \u201cthe Gulf War proved that space weapons systems have become an indispensable part of the system of modern operations, regardless of whether this is in strategic actions or in tactical actions.\u201d The various kinds of military satellites (see Table 7-1) that the United States used in the Gulf War provided information support for operations at all times and spaces, in all time domains, and in all directions, in a highly efficient manner. The four great systems that they formed, for space reconnaissance and surveillance, space communications support, space navigation and positioning, and space weather support, provided high-quality, urgently needed, and reliable information for operations; this was used on a large scale by the multinational force in the war, and it vigorously supported joint operations on the ground.

It also had three Fleet Communications satellites and one Leasat-3 assume the task of naval communications. And the British military used the Skynet-4 satellite, and the French military used Syracuse military communications circuits on the Telecommunications-1A and the Telecommunications-1C. Satellite communications made up eighty-five percent of the total amount of internal and external communications in the theater of war. In order to provide operational units with precise navigation and positioning information, the United States deployed eighteen GPS-2A global navigation and positioning system satellites in outer space. The ground operations units, aircraft, ships, and special operations units of the multinational force had approximately 5,500 military positioning and navigation receivers as well as 10,000 civilian receivers; these could receive highly precise three-dimensional navigation and positioning signals for more than twenty hours every day. GPS receivers were installed on precision-guided weapons, and these were effective in enhancing the accuracy of the weapons\u2019 strikes and their attack capabilities. Assisted by these accurate navigation and positioning signals, F-16 [Fighting Falcon] fighters, B-52 [Stratofortress] bombers, and RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft could carry out their military missions accurately and without error in all weathers; tank formations could carry out precision movements in the desert zones that had no landform characteristics; minesweeping units could safely pass through minefields and accurately determine the locations of mines in order to make it easy to destroy these; and supply transportation vehicles could find combat personnel in the desert and provide them with supplies. In naval operations and in supporting busy ocean shipping, GPS enabled naval ships and the large number of commercial vessels carrying supplies to get accurate navigation and positioning. The multinational force used imagery reconnaissance satellites to carry out all-weather reconnaissance against important targets like Iraq\u2019s command centers, airfields, Scud missile launchers, air defense missile batteries, and communications nodes, and they used \u201cland\u201d satellites and two French SPOT satellites to do general surveys with rather low resolution over broad areas; the information that was obtained played an important role in large-scale air raids and ground operations. Imagery reconnaissance also had the task of evaluating and appraising the results of bombing and destruction against targets, and they provided a basis for determining the time when ground units would launch assaults. The multinational force used electronic reconnaissance satellites and other land, sea, and air reconnaissance platforms together to create a three-dimensional reconnaissance intelligence system to closely reconnoiter Iraq\u2019s electromagnetic spectrum activities, to collect its signal characteristics and parameters, to ascertain the various frequency band signals, and to thus carry out support for electronic warfare operations. Electronic reconnaissance satellites listened in on the Iraqi military\u2019s most important radio communications channels, including the channels used by Iraqi President Saddam [Hussein] and senior commanders in the Republican Guard and the channels used by the Iraqi military\u2019s military command organizations\u2019 communications network, so that the multinational force was able to stay abreast of any major military actions by the Iraqi military. The United States used two Defense Support Program (NSP) [sic] early warning satellites to detect launch conditions for Iraqi Scud missiles and to provide four to five minutes of early warning to residents in Israel and to the units deployed in Saudi Arabia (Scud missiles\u2019 flight time was about seven minutes). At the same time, they provided crucially important early warning data for Patriot anti-missile systems to intercept [the Scuds], thus creating a precedent for ground interception weapons to carry out actual combat in missile interception.", "metadata": "2022-08-12 Lectures on the Science of Space Operations.md", "judgement": true}, "22": {"text": "On March 26 , 2019 , Philip Davidson , commander of the U.S. Indo - Pacific Command , stated in the House of Representatives that the U.S. military must \u201c be able to defend its own power and project power to ensure that any opponent can cannot achieve dominance in the Indo-Pacific region . \u201d ( 2) Great Power Competition and Unconventional Warfare In the era of great power confrontation, unconventional warfare will still occupy an important position. We must also see that as the information technology revolution is in full swing, the advantages of state actors over non-state actors in certain fields are increasing. As Michael Howard puts it, technological advancements have led to a so-called \" war revolution \" in U.S. military equipment , allowing the United States to monitor and block its adversaries' communications to gain the upper hand. This is in line with the general direction of current scientific and technological development. The manpower, material resources and time required for scientific and technological innovation and industrial development are beyond the reach of non-state actors. The entry threshold for high technology is getting higher and higher, and it is increasingly concentrated in a few large countries. State actors are at an absolute disadvantage in technological competition . In unconventional warfare, major powers have an advantage in offense and defense due to their technological superiority. Great powers can reverse the unfavorable situation on the battlefield by developing new weapons. In other words, the current era is conducive to offense . Does this mean that non-state actors are at an overall disadvantage? Not exactly. It must be noted that state actors also have certain vulnerabilities in war. First, great powers also have organizational and technological vulnerabilities. Societies of state actors are generally open and pluralistic, and lack sufficient cohesion when facing non-state actors. For the military, blind pursuit of new technologies will lead people to become addicted to technology, thereby forming technological dependence. High-tech weapons and communication systems are vulnerable, and if they fail on the battlefield, there will be serious consequences. Secondly, although unconventional wars are less intense, they are more frequent and are a common political phenomenon in the international community. Keegan believes that future wars will occur in very remote places, but the military has not yet acknowledged this. It should be noted that as the intensity of strategic competition increases, major powers may shift their military attention to competing for these marginal areas, leading to an increase in unconventional wars. Finally, in an era when great power wars are returning, how to deal with unconventional wars still poses a huge challenge to the great powers. After the \"9\u00b711\" incident, wars continued between the United States and non-state actors . On February 29 , 2020 , representatives of the United States and the Afghan Taliban signed a peace agreement in Doha, the capital of Qatar , under which the United States will withdraw its troops from Afghanistan in phases. By political standards, the U.S. war in Afghanistan ended in failure. In fact, so far, major powers have still not found good means to deal with unconventional warfare . However , what is certain is that great power competition will not weaken the status of unconventional warfare, and may even highlight its unique strategic significance to some extent. Specific to China and the United States, the probability of a large-scale military confrontation between the two sides is very low. In the strategic competition between China and the United States, unconventional warfare will have a very special status. The basic logic is that long-term confrontation between major powers requires competitors to seek asymmetric advantages. As a result, two forms of military confrontation may emerge between major powers . The first form is that major powers may engage in low-intensity military conflicts. In addition to competition in the economic, political and high-tech fields, the great power competition led by the United States also occurs in the military field. The US military is currently advancing the \" grey zone \" strategy. In the past few years, the US military has gradually realized that there are still some \" grey areas \" between war and peace . It must be tactically flexible to respond to competitors' \" gray area \" strategies, and at the same time actively promote its own \" gray area \" strategy. Respond to your competitors' challenges through a variety of tactics. In maritime security competition, the United States chooses a \" gray zone \" strategy based on its understanding of China's military strength in an attempt to offset China's \" gray zone \" advantages. Some scholars believe that the United States has adopted six types of \" grey zone \" strategies against China: narrative war, issue linkage, civil intervention, free navigation, forward presence, and military alliance. These actions by the United States are conducive to enhancing its strategic flexibility and helping it cope with China's growing military power. However, these actions also increase the risk of regional conflict. The United States chose the \" grey zone \" strategy mainly based on the consideration of maintaining asymmetric advantages. In strategic competition, whether for a stronger country or a weaker country, the pursuit of asymmetric advantages requires flexibility. This has happened before in the history of the United States. During the Eisenhower administration, the United States launched a large-scale retaliation strategy in an attempt to deter the Soviet Union through the advantage of nuclear weapons to reduce the cost of confrontation and thereby gain the initiative. However, this made the United States unable to respond to the diverse military strategies from the Soviet Union and lost strategic flexibility. In response to the Soviet military strategy, the United States finally abandoned its large-scale retaliation strategy and introduced a flexible response strategy. The form of military confrontation between great powers in the new era is not unconventional war in nature, but it is also very different from the conventional war between great powers. This kind of conflict has a hybrid aspect, and is close to conventional war and irregular war on the spectrum. intermediate form. This form of conflict will significantly increase the frequency of unconventional wars, which will not only occur in the \" grey areas \" between major powers , but are more likely to occur in peripheral areas outside the major powers . The second form is that major powers carry out proxy wars in other regions. The cost of direct military confrontation between major powers is huge, and wars between nuclear powers have become extinct . If there is a military confrontation between major powers , it may be a short-lived conflict in a specific region, on a specific issue, and proxy war therefore becomes a reasonable choice and a logical strategy and tactic. Among them, some non-state actors have become important weights for major powers, and unconventional warfare has become an indispensable policy option for major powers. For some non-state actors, they will also seek asymmetric advantages by leveraging major powers to achieve their political goals. In the past 20 years, from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Ukraine to Syria, from Libya to Yemen, proxy wars have become a means for countries to achieve political interests. Take Iran as an example, it is trying to promote a \" proxy \" strategy in the Middle East . With its strong support, the Houthi armed forces in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Iraqi militias have all become important forces in Iran's non-state actor network, making great contributions to Iran's expansion of regional influence. Different countries have different reasons for using proxy wars: for powerful countries represented by the United States, the reason for choosing proxies is very simple, that is, the cost is lower and there is no need to pay the price of casualties; for weaker countries, In other words, because they lack the ability to project military power, influencing the situation through proxies is often their only option. In the context of great power competition, most proxy wars are unconventional wars. This form of war must attract our attention . 6. Conclusion 21st century , conservatism, nationalism and extremism have become important social forces. Under their influence, unconventional warfare has become an important political phenomenon and has posed severe challenges to the international community. For major countries in the international community, this phenomenon deserves special attention. According to what was mentioned above, unconventional warfare has a certain historical background and social foundation. As the United States adopts a contraction strategy and reduces its involvement in the Middle East, the great power factors behind unconventional wars in the Middle East have declined to a certain extent. At the same time, the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, and the political turmoil and civil wars since the changes in West Asia and North Africa have released to a certain extent regional conflicts that have accumulated over a long period of time. The intensity of unconventional wars may decline to a certain extent in the future. However, unconventional warfare has not ended. It will still maintain a considerable proportion and intensity, and there is a risk of it intensifying again in the future. In the face of great power competition and the challenge of unconventional warfare, great powers must make corresponding adjustments in their military systems, military doctrines, strategies, tactics, and weapons and equipment . First, the military system must be reformed in a timely manner to balance the relationship between unconventional warfare and conventional warfare. War is an external driving force for organizational innovation. Under huge external pressure, countries must innovate political and social organizations. After the \"9\u00b711\" incident, the United States was committed to reforming its military system and adjusting its national defense system to meet the requirements of counter-terrorism. The lessons of the United States also tell us that while attaching importance to unconventional warfare, we should also take conventional warfare into consideration. The current international security environment is diverse and complex. Therefore, the construction of military systems must meet the characteristics of flexibility and speed, and form \" modular \" combat units that are smaller, faster, and more tactically flexible, and can be flexibly combined and combined according to changes in the external environment. Be flexible and adapt to your opponent's adjustments. The new form of war also requires the country to reform its organizational culture, form a tradition within the military that focuses on actual combat, and encourage officers at all levels to combine practical experience with theoretical creation. In addition, the command system should be improved and a joint command structure should be actively established. Taking the U.S. military as an example, the combat command chain consists of three levels: the highest command authority, joint combat commands, and military components, in which the joint combat commands play a key role. In terms of crisis response and operations, the joint command system is more centralized, which is conducive to improving the combat capabilities of the troops and is the basic guarantee for winning modern joint operations . Second, we need to develop some new military theories applicable to unconventional warfare. The innovation of war has great international political significance. Taking the Napoleonic War in history as an example, nationalism, popular politics and modern ideology have shaped the overall purpose of war, and the industrial revolution has reshaped the shape of war. History tells us that major powers must keep pace with the times and keep up with the forefront of world military theory to cope with the challenges of a complex world. It is undeniable that the current concept of conventional warfare still firmly occupies the mainstream of military doctrines in various countries, and countries still place the construction of traditional military power at the core. Especially after Trump came to power, great power competition has intensified again, and conventional military theories on great power war will return to the center of the stage of theoretical innovation. However, it must be noted that the probability of war between major powers is still very low, and small-scale unconventional wars are the norm in the international community. The biggest problem facing traditional military power is that it is tailor-made for large-scale wars, so it faces many difficulties when conducting small-scale wars. Therefore, when dealing with small-scale unconventional wars, major powers need to innovate military doctrines and develop great-power war theories that suit their own national conditions. The academic and policy circles should also discuss relevant military concepts in a timely manner and conduct in-depth research on the latest forms of warfare . Third, strategies and tactics should be adjusted to deal not only with conventional wars, but also with irregular wars. Great powers must also keep up with the trend of military confrontation in the new era and develop strategies and tactics suitable for great power competition in the new situation. In future wars, major powers must handle battles in multiple fields such as land, sea, air, space, network, and electromagnetic fields. It is also necessary to integrate personnel, weapons, networks, and sensors from all services to improve the level of information warfare. At the same time, in the information age, the public is more easily mobilized, and social organizations are also experiencing new development trends. In the context of the new era, the traditional tactics of using large-scale troops to suppress the military power of non-state actors and then concentrating firepower on strikes are no longer effective. The tactics used by state actors to combat non-state actors need to be reformed. Paying attention to intelligence work and carrying out targeted killings through special forces or drones have become important tactical means in unconventional warfare.", "metadata": "Unconventional Wars Evolution of War_RenDa_17JUN22_en.docx", "judgement": true}, "23": {"text": "On the eve of the 1991 Gulf War, [the number of] DSCS-3 satellite terminals that the US military deployed in the Gulf region increased from four to more than 120, and they were used to complete combat, combat support, combat logistics support, and other communications missions. The multinational force\u2019s air force headquarters used Defense Satellite Communications System every day to send air raid mission orders to the various operational units, making air attacks timely and effective. The antennas for ground mobile unit users\u2019 terminals were installed on flatbed trucks and followed units\u2019 movements; when the units halted, [the terminals] established contact with command posts. In all, there were thirty-three mobile terminals serving combat units, providing prompt command, control, communications, and intelligence information. In the initial period of the war, the Defense Satellite Communications System undertook seventy-five percent of theater of war communications; in particular, it played a major support role for units that were fairly far from the theater of war and that had no ground communications systems support. (2) Russia\u2019s Molniya satellite communications system The Soviet Union was the earliest country in the world to launch a satellite, and its satellite communication system also developed fairly early. In 1965, not only did it launch the first Molniya communications experimental satellite, but it also began establishing a satellite communications system. Currently, the Molniya-3 communications satellite system used by Russia is its third generation, and it primarily provides strategic communications service for the military. The Molniya satellite communications system has the following characteristics. First, the satellites have a high elliptical orbit with a twelve-hour period, their perigee is at about 500 kilometers in the southern hemisphere, and their orbital inclination is sixty-five degrees. This is because most of Russia\u2019s territory is located in the high latitude regions of the northern hemisphere, and some of its territory is in the north polar region; if a geostationary orbit were used, the communications effects would not be good, and moreover there would be no way to have communications in the north polar region. But by using a high elliptical orbit and having the apogee adjusted to the space above the northern hemisphere, it is possible to have the satellites\u2019 longest flight time be in the space above [Russia\u2019s] own territory. The Molniya satellites usually work in a network of eight satellites, operating in four orbital planes separated ninety degrees from each other in a dual mode. In this way, it is possible to ensure continual global communications twenty-four hours [a day]. Second, the communications capacity is limited. A Molniya satellite only has three transponders and can provide only 200 circuits for telephone calls or three circuits for television, so it has a certain disparity with the large capacity requirements of strategic communications. Third, [the satellites] have great need for ground systems; their ground applications systems consist of eighty-five ground stations. Because Molniya satellites operate in a high elliptical orbit, the antennas of their ground systems need to continually track the satellites, so the technology is more complex. (3) The United States\u2019 Milstar system The United States\u2019 Milstar system, whose full name is the Military Strategic and Tactical Relay system and which uses extremely high frequency (EHG) wavebands, is the most advanced satellite communications system in today\u2019s world. This system combines strategic communications, tactical communications, and data relay functions into one. The Milstar satellite communications system began undergoing research and development in the 1980s and by now has already had two generations develop, respectively Milstar 1 and Milstar 2. Milstar 1\u2019s reinforcement against nuclear [explosions] was fairly strong, and it was primarily used for strategic communications. Milstar 2 has no reinforcement against nuclear [explosions], and it is primarily used for tactical communications. The constellation consists of two Milstar 1 and three Milstar 2 satellites, for a total of five [satellites]. The system\u2019s main characteristics [are as follows]. First, its communications capacity is great and its processing capabilities are strong. The satellites have fifteen secondary antennas and use such autonomous processing systems as signals code processing, capturing and processing of timing and signals, processing of links between satellites, and overall processing, and they have signal modulation and demodulation [functions] and beam switching functions. They use three frequency bands: ultrahigh frequency, superhigh frequency, and extremely high frequency, simultaneously supporting strategic and tactical communications. They use sixty gigahertz broadband links to carry out communications among satellites, linking a number of satellites in orbit to form a constellation. Second, they use adaptive nulling antenna technology to improve their ability to resist jamming. What is called adaptive nulling antennas means that the antenna\u2019s main beams are always aligned with the signals direction, and the signals null point is always aligned with the source of jamming. Because jamming is random, adaptive nulling antennas can automatically adjust to changes in the antenna direction pattern, and always track the direction of jamming. In addition, because the beam length is quite short and the beams are quite narrow, it is possible [to have] highly directional emissions, making it quite hard to eavesdrop on and jam [signals]. In addition, satellites\u2019 regenerative processing technology limits the accumulation of noise and jamming, thus further enhancing the system\u2019s anti-jamming ability. At the same time, the extensive use of narrowband and broadband spread spectrum and frequency modulated technology also makes it very difficult for the enemy to intercept their communication. Third, it works using the form of networks whose orbits intersect, thus enhancing resistance to destruction and survival capabilities. Some satellites\u2019 orbits are higher than geostationary orbits, for fairly long periods of time, and anti-satellite means cannot reach this altitude. Satellites in geostationary orbit also adopt preventive measures, taking along sufficient fuel, so that as soon as they come under attack, they can immediately ignite their engines and engage in flexible dodging and mobile shifts. Backup satellites that are placed in orbit do not work in peacetime and are put in a secret status; they can move, based on orders, and reinforce the system\u2019s work capabilities from a suitable location. Therefore, the Milstar system also can provide regular communications services in a complex battlefield environment and has quite strong survival capabilities. # II. Tracking and data relay satellite systems...111 # 1. Overview Tracking and data relay satellite systems are space relay stations that can track earth orbit flight vehicles, including space shuttles, and can return data to earth stations. They are one of the important means for carrying out global reconnaissance and surveillance and for providing real-time information delivery for strategic early warning, as well as an indispensably important component part in establishing a global space-based comprehensive information network. They are primarily used for real-time relay transmission of information for various types of low earth orbit spacecraft users, and for expanding the scope of coverage for low earth orbit spacecraft tracking. Tracking and data relay satellite systems not only are hubs by which medium and near earth orbit spacecraft transmit information in real-time, but they also are important platforms for forming space-based tracking networks. They also have a very important role in manned spaceflight and deep-space probes. Because the amount of data that imaging reconnaissance satellites transmit is quite large, and because it is necessary to prevent data interception by other nations, it is therefore necessary to rely upon data relay satellites to carry out high-capacity, high-speed data relay in real-time. Currently, the United States, the European Union, and Japan are developing new generations of tracking and data relay satellite systems; data transmission speeds are getting faster and faster, and communications frequency bands are developing towards the Ka band and optical frequency bands. 2. Typical satellite relay systems (1) The United States\u2019 \u201cTracking and Data Relay Satellites\u201d In 1975, the United States began research and development of \u201cTracking and Data Relay Satellites\u201d (TDRS). From 1983 to 1995, it launched a total of seven first-generation TDRS satellites; the satellites had seven differing types of antennas and could simultaneous use S, C, and Ku bands, while their data transmission speeds reached 300 megabits per second. These satellites and a ground station set up in White Sands, New Mexico, formed the United States\u2019 first-generation TDRS network, and its coverage in near earth orbit reached eighty-five percent. Starting in 1995, the United States planned to research second-generation TDRS satellites, whose working frequency bands would be S, Ku, and Ka, and that would develop toward the Ka band, so that the space-based tracking network would have coverage of 85 percent to 100 percent. This system can transmit in real-time various types of data information from earth-monitoring satellites, such as Lacrosse reconnaissance satellites forwarding SAR imaging data, and transmitting information services for a new generation of the Earth Observing System (EOS). (2) Russia\u2019s tracking and data relay satellite system Russia\u2019s tracking and data relay satellite system is divided into two main categories: civilian and military. The civilian tracking and data relay satellite system is divided into three independent networks \u2013 eastern, central, and western \u2013 and is called the Luch system. This system\u2019s primarily direction of service was to provide communications and control for low earth orbit satellites and to provide two-way data exchanges with earth stations for the Mir space station, the Salyut space station, Soyuz spaceships, and the Almaz [satellite\u2019s] synthetic aperture radar. The Potok military tracking and data relay satellite system, which was launched in 1982, used the C band, and the satellite antenna was a phased array antenna; it was primarily used for optical imaging reconnaissance, ocean monitoring, and other military satellites. # Section 4: Space Operations Weapons Systems...113 The huge role in warfare of satellites and other spacecraft has resulted in an everincreasing number of countries fully realizing the necessity and importance of developing space weapons. At the same time that they are actively developing satellites, space shuttles, space stations, and other military spacecraft, the issue of how to prevent an enemy from using space or how to carry out a counterattack when the enemy launches an assault against your own spacecraft, of how to bring the altitude advantage of space into play, of how to seize and hold command of space, and of how to attack ground, aerial, and maritime targets from space, have all impelled the applications of space weapons. Space operations weapons systems conceptually are divided into a narrow sense and a broad sense. Space operations weapons systems in the narrow sense refer especially to weapons systems deployed on space-based platforms and directly used to kill the opponent\u2019s outer space, aerial, maritime, and land operations targets. Space operations weapons systems in the broad sense refer to weapons systems deployed in outer space, on land, at sea, and in the air that are used to attack and destroy enemy targets flying in outer space and to attack from outer space important targets on land, at sea, and in the air. Looking at functions, space operations weapons systems can be divided into two categories: hard kill and soft kill. Speaking specifically, they primarily include antisatellite weapons, anti-ballistic missile weapons, and orbital bombardment weapons. Anti-satellite weapons refer to weapons systems used to jam or damage satellites operating in outer space; these are currently a relatively mature type of space operations weapons system. Currently, anti-satellite weapons largely can be divided into three types. The first is kinetic energy weapons, including anti-satellite missiles with nuclear warheads or conventional warheads and kinetic energy interceptors that rely upon direct collisions to kill the [enemy] satellite. The second is directed energy weapons, including laser weapons, particle beam weapons, and high-powered microwave weapons. The third is electronic warfare weapons, which are used to jam satellites\u2019 communications and data transmissions. # I.

CONCLUSIONS \nThe debate about whether China\u2019s strategic preferences are constrained or even shaped by Confucian morality is far from resolved. Patterns of actual and recommended uses of force often contradict China\u2019s claims to hold nonviolent and non-aggressive preferences yet they can be inconsistent with realist assumptions as well. Yet, qualitatively measuring consistency according to these cultural strategic preferences assumes that states behave rationally - as defined by the researcher. Even if true, the manner in which an ethical framework helps consider responses to a threat is highly subjective and variable depending upon context, perspective, and the individual\u2019s interpretations of the principles. The consideration of cultural influences when defining assumptions about war and international affairs and characterizing what is a rational relationship between these assumptions and the use of force makes this an effective approach for testing but not validating explanatory theories. It provides flexibility to compare the \u201cfit\u201d between the normative strategic preferences of different theories and when and how wars were actually fought but, as a result, there is limited available insight into how decision makers weighed moral and amoral factors as well as into their beliefs about the constraining role of morality in international relations. War inherently requires frequent decisions about whether it is better or worse to violate the moral principle to not do harm in order to do a greater good as well as about when this consideration should constrain doing what is most effective. An outside observer who does not know how this weighing was done could see the resulting behavior as immoral or inconsistent with the professed ethical framework. The conduct of the war generally does not provide any insight, either, as it provides no meaningful clues whether the decision maker believed that the behavior, even if inconsistent with normative preferences, qualified as moral self-defense, was immoral but necessary due to an exceptional threat, or was immoral but necessary yet made more acceptable by using moral language. The hegemonic and highly subjective nature of Confucian ethics makes it further difficult to discern the perceived moral content of a war based upon whether China counters threats using aggressive or minimally-violent strategies and whether the use of force increases with its perceived efficacy. The use of offensive, coercive measures and consideration of the efficacy of war are not mutually exclusive to realist or Confucian beliefs. Confucian strategic preferences derive from moral ideals which may not be an effective way to respond to less- than-ideal threats. Assumptions and preferences are not concrete rules so they don\u2019t indicate whether morality constrains using force when and how most effective. The complex and diverse methods of moral reasoning about war and the limits to understanding how this was done by looking at historical behaviour mean that the relationships between moral ideals and paradigmatic beliefs, the roles of assumptions and preferences, and the rational connection between beliefs and behaviour should be examined more closely. Key insight for resolving the ambiguities between the realist and Confucian models would come from identifying what issues besides efficacy are important when determining how best to pursue national goals; what severity of threat necessitates immoral uses of force; and what actions qualify as \u201cself-defense.\u201d Ultimately, the lack of absolute rules in ethics and moral decision making about war means that the most important testable metric of moral influence is the consistency and coherence of beliefs, decisions, and behavior. These add context about how China views the international system and how it will most likely perceive and respond to threats.

Strengthen international communication and promote discourse capacity building. General Secretary Xi Jinping made clear demands: \u201c We must strive to promote the building of international communication capabilities, innovate external publicity methods, strengthen the construction of discourse systems, strive to create new concepts, new categories and new expressions that integrate China and foreign countries, tell Chinese stories well, spread China\u2019s voice well, and enhance The right to speak in the international arena. \" First, we must integrate Chinese and Western characteristics and promote the construction of a discourse system.

Mahnken To cope with a rising China, other powers will need a close understanding of Chinese strategic culture. This paper presents an initial attempt to redress this gap. It seeks to identify the enduring features of Chinese strategic culture, assess their role in Chinese policy, and consider their implications for the future posture and responses of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Drawing on ancient texts, modern official documents and accounts of Beijing\u2019s decision-making during crises, Secrecy & Stratagem raises important questions about the potentially risky relationship between Chinese strategic culture, misperception and miscalculation in Asia\u2019s uncertain security future. Secrecy and Stratagem: Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture Thomas G. Mahnken February 2011 Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture Contents Introduction Defining Strategic Culture National Strategic Culture Military Strategic Culture Topics for Further Study Notes References Secrecy and Stratagem 1. Introduction It appears that the United States is in a military competition with China that, for planning purposes, can be assumed to go on for the foreseeable future. As the 2008 National Defense Strategy states, \u201cThe Department will respond to China\u2019s expanding military power, and to the uncertainties over how it might be used, through shaping and hedging. This approach tailors investment of substantial, though not infinite, resources in ways that favor key enduring U.S. advantages. At the same time, we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to China if necessary.\u201d To have any hope of success, any strategy for dealing with China over the long term should be based upon an understanding both of the United States\u2019 enduring strengths and weaknesses and those of China. These features should flow from sources that are immutable, such as geography, or that change slowly and predictably, such as culture or demography. During the Cold War, the United States over time developed a good understanding of key features of Soviet strategic culture. These features, which included the imperative of defending the Russian Motherland (Rodina) from attack and a centralised style of command and control, served as the basis for strategy development and force modernisation. For example, recognition of the importance that the Soviet government placed on defending the Motherland, manifested in the existence of national air defence forces (Protivovozdushnoi Oborony Strany, or PVO Strany) as a separate service with high levels of investment in air defence, informed U.S. decisions to maintain a manned penetrating bomber force as well as develop new systems such as the B-2 stealth bomber. The United States currently lacks a similar appreciation of the main tenets of Chinese strategic culture. This paper presents an initial attempt to redress this gap. In particular, it seeks to understand the enduring features of Chinese strategic culture, develop indicators that could be used to validate whether these features are indeed operative and enduring, and explicate potential implications of these features for strategy development. It is based upon three types of evidence: (1) translations of both ancient Chinese texts on strategy, such as Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War, and a sampling of modern official documents, such as the Chinese defence white papers and The Science of Military Strategy; (2) analyses of Chinese strategic culture by American, French, and Chinese scholars; and (3) other evidence, such as accounts of Chinese crisis decision-making and patterns of military deployments. There are two compelling reasons to study Chinese strategic culture. First, it may give us insight into Chinese decision-making. Indeed, it may help us understand behaviour that on the face of it seems irrational. Moreover, certain features of strategic culture may promote misperception. For example, one would expect a state possessing a highly ethnocentric strategic culture to overestimate its capabilities relative to those of potential adversaries. A second reason to study Chinese strategic culture is that the Chinese themselves see it as an important determinant of their behaviour and that of others. Indeed, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) has published a book on the subject entitled Analysis of China\u2019s Strategic Culture, which explores Chinese strategic culture in depth and contrasts it with \u201cWestern\u201d strategic culture. In the words of Lieutenant General Li Jijun, the former Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, \u201cCulture is the root and foundation of strategy. Strategic thinking, in the process of its evolutionary history, flows into the mainstream of a country or a nation\u2019s strategic culture. Each country or nation\u2019s strategic culture cannot but bear the imprint of cultural traditions, which, in a subconscious and complex way, prescribes and defines strategy making.\u201d Similarly, the authors of the Chinese handbook The Science of Military Strategy argue that, \u201cStrategic thought is always formed on the basis of certain historical and national cultural tradition, and formulation and performance of strategy by strategists are always controlled and driven by certain cultural ideology and historical cultural complex.\u201d Most Chinese military leaders believe that ancient Chinese values and warfighting principles remain relevant today. Ancient Chinese philosophical texts, military treatises such as The Art of War and the Seven Military Classics of Ancient China, and literary classics such as Journey to the West and The Water Margin are central to the identity of the PLA. The PLA teaches that its members are heirs to an ancient Chinese legacy and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s revolutionary struggles. PLA military handbooks routinely refer to battles fought 4,000 years ago as object lessons, and PLA leaders seek guidance from 2,500-year-old writings for modern operations. Indeed, even today, Chinese officers freely distribute translations of the Chinese military classics to their hosts. Chinese strategists also view others as possessing their own unique strategic culture. For example, they contrast an expansionist, bellicose \u201cWestern\u201d way of war with what they see as their own pacifist tradition. Organisation of this paper Chapter 2 begins by defining the concept of strategic culture and discussing challenges to operationalising it. Chapter 3 describes the four tenets of China\u2019s national strategic culture: \u2022 China is culturally superior \u2022 China\u2019s natural position is that of the \u201cMiddle Kingdom\u201d \u2022 China must be unified internally and free from external meddling, and \u2022 war is costly, destructive, and leads to internal dissension. Chapter 4 describes the four tenets of China\u2019s military strategic culture: \u2022 safeguarding Chinese territorial integrity is an important military mission \u2022 the goal of strategy is to exploit the propensity of things, or shi, \u2022 to achieve one\u2019s objectives war is a scientific process, and through secrecy and stratagem, \u2022 it is possible to achieve a decisive victory against a superior adversary Chapter 5 contains recommendations for further research. Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture 2. Defining Strategic Culture The literature examining culture and its application to international affairs is rich. The sociologist Clifford Geertz, for example, defined culture as a \u201csystem of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes towards life.\u201d Similarly, Jack Snyder has termed culture \u201ca set of semi-permanent elite beliefs, attitudes, and behavior patterns socialized into a distinctive mode of thought.\u201d Definitions of strategic culture similarly vary somewhat. Andrew Scobell has defined it as \u201ca persistent system of values held in common by the leaders or group of leaders of a state concerning the use of military force.\u201d The Defense Threat Reduction Agency\u2019s Comparative Strategic Cultures project proposed that strategic cultures consist of \u201cshared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.\u201d This paper adopts Alastair Iain Johnston\u2019s definition of strategic culture as an integrated \u201csystem of symbols (e.g., argumentation structures, analogies, metaphors) which acts to establish pervasive and long-lasting strategic preferences by formulating concepts of the role and efficacy of military force in interstate political affairs, and by clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the strategic preferences seem uniquely realistic and efficacious.\u201d Or in other words, strategic culture consists of a limited, consistently ranked set of preferences that is persistent over time. Culture thus closely resembles the cognitive and motivational biases discussed in political science literature. The line between culture and cognitive processes is less distinct than was once thought. Recent research by Richard E. Nisbett and others challenges the long-held belief that cognitive processes are universal. To the contrary, Nisbett and his colleagues have provided some evidence that the considerable social differences that exist between cultures affect not only beliefs about specific aspects of the world but also the nature of cognitive processes. Social organization directs attention to certain aspects of reality at the expense of others. What people pay attention to, in turn, affects their beliefs about the functioning of the world and causality. For example, whereas Western civilisation is dominated by personal agency, Chinese culture emphasizes reciprocal social obligation and collective agency. The Chinese believe that people are part of a collective and that the behavior of the individual should be guided by group expectations. Nisbett\u2019s research shows that cultural traditions in general influence systems of thought, and that Asians in particular possess systems of thought that are highly influenced by their holistic cultural tradition. In a series of psychological experiments, Nisbett and Takahiko Masuda showed that Asians, more than Americans, explain events in their context. In separate research, Nisbett and Incheol Choi have shown that Asians, because of their holistic reasoning, take inconsistency for granted and are consequently less likely than Americans to experience surprise. Strategic cultures may share features. For example, just because a belief in the efficacy of deception is a feature of Chinese strategic culture, it does not follow that such a belief is uniquely Chinese. Other cultures, such as that of Persia (Iran), also put great weight on stratagem. Similarly, just because culture is influential, it is not necessarily determinative. As Alexander L. George wrote forty years ago, culture \u201cinfluences, but does not unilaterally determine, decision-making; it is an important, but not the only, variable that shapes decision-making behavior.\u201d Or, as the Chinese military authors Peng Guangqian and Yao Youzhi put it, \u201cCulture is not tantamount to behavior, nor is tradition to realities. However, cultural tradition, no doubt, may influence on choice of behavior in realities.\u201d Key to understanding strategic culture, therefore, is understanding just how much of an effect strategic culture has on behavior. Culture must, of course, be applied carefully. Not to do so \u201crisks replacing strategy with stereotypes,\u201d as Patrick Porter observed. One of the central challenges that the student of any nation\u2019s strategic culture faces is determining which institutions serve as the keeper and transmitter of strategic culture. Is it the state? The military as a whole? Or some subset of the military? Another challenge lies in identifying the content of strategic culture, the most salient beliefs and attitudes that make up culture. Last but not least is the challenge of determining the extent to which strategic culture, rather than power considerations, actually determines attitudes and behavior. One particular challenge in dealing with Chinese strategic culture involves disentangling how Chinese leaders portray themselves from how they act. As Andrew Scobell has noted, most Chinese elites believe that China possesses a uniquely pacifistic strategic culture, that China has never been an expansionist state, and that China has never fought an aggressive war in its history. The stereotypical view of China adopted by scholars in China, as well as in the West, is one of a state possessing a weak martial tradition and a cultural predisposition to seek non-violent solutions to problems of state. However, this self-image has not always influenced practice. As Warren I. Cohen has observed, \u201cIn the creation of their empire, the Chinese were no less arrogant, no less ruthless, than the Europeans, Japanese, or Americans in the creation of theirs.\u201d Rather, successive generations of Chinese scholars created a narrative that shows that foreign nations have long sought to deny China its sovereignty. At the military strategic level, this narrative argues that the PLA saved China from foreign aggression and domestic tyranny and prevented more powerful adversaries from interfering in Chinese affairs. The military narrative stresses that China has only fought when forced to do so, and has always fought in a defensive and moral fashion. It also highlights the fact that the PLA has won every war even when it faced more advanced adversaries. Alastair Iain Johnston\u2019s careful work on the Ming period (1368\u20131644) concluded, however, that no pacifist bias appeared in the Chinese strategic tradition. By contrast, China\u2019s leaders operated according to the dictates of Realpolitik even if they often cloaked their actions in Confucian rationalizations.", "metadata": "Mahnken - Secrecy & Stratagem-cl.docx", "judgement": true}, "28": {"text": "Seizing information dominance is the core of seizing the initiative {zhudongquan} in blockade operations. They should establish a land, sea, air, and space integrated $\\{ y i t i \\}$ IO reconnaissance distribution system, to rigorously surveil and accurately grasp the situation of the enemy\u2019s IO force-strengths and weapons and its EM activity $\\{ h u o d o n g \\}$ , so as to provide a foundation for IO command decision-making {zhihui juece} and operational activities. They should concentrate use of the campaign\u2019s directly subordinate electronic offensive [attack] {dianzi jingong} strengths as well as those of the various services and arms, and under coordination with and complementation by other operational strengths, conduct key point jamming and suppression and destruction or sabotage of the vital site targets in the enemy\u2019s counter-blockade operational information system. [They should] at the right time apply network attack strengths to execute attacks on the network systems of the enemy\u2019s operational SoS, and to seize battlefield local information dominance, so as to create favorable conditions for the blockade operational activities. When seizing air dominance/supremacy, they should take the air information attack strengths as primary, and synthetically apply multiple information attack strengths, for key point jamming and suppressing and destroying or sabotaging of enemy early warning and detection systems, air defense and anti-missile command communication {fangkong fandao zhihui tongxin} systems, air defense weapons control systems, and information attack {xinxi gongji} systems which constitute threats to our air blockade operational activities, so as to assist-support and complement our operational activities to seize air dominance/supremacy.

In the phase for seizing blockade operational-area dominance, they should fully exploit means such as various types of propaganda and PSYWAR weapons, to execute psychological attacks against the enemy, so as to complement the operational activities of the other information attack strengths; and for important information targets, [they should] adopt information defense measures, to ensure our operational INFOSEC and the bringing into play of the information systems\u2019 effectiveness. # III. IO activities in the sustained blockade phase\u2026287 The JCC and his command organ should base themselves on protracted operations {chijiu zuozhan}, and uninterruptedly organize and command the IO strengths, while conducting continuous R&S of the enemy\u2019s important information system targets, in concentrating use of information attack strengths to conduct jamming and suppression and destruction or sabotage against those targets, so as to assist-support and complement the sustained blockade by the Navy, Air Force, and Second Artillery Corps against the enemy\u2019s air and sea lines of communication [SLOC] {haishang jiaotongxian}, and their sustained sabotage activities against important targets in the enemy-held islands. During sustained blockade of SLOC, [the JCC and command organ] should carry out rigorous monitoring {\u76d1\u63a7 jiankong} of EM signals and hydroacoustic signals {shuisheng xinhao} in the important blockade operational areas, to timely grasp the dynamic state {dongtai} of the enemy penetration force-strengths $\\{ t u p o b i n g l i \\}$ and antisubmarine force-strengths {fanqian bingli}. For newly detected enemy concealed electronic information targets and mobile detection and early warning {jidong tance yujing} systems, [they should] carry out reconnaissance and positioning $\\{ d i n g w e i \\}$ , and conduct jamming and suppression or destruction and sabotage of them. [They should] strengthen surface R&S {haimian zhencha, jianshi} of the blockade mine area $\\{ l e i q u \\}$ situation, to provide intelligence assisting support {qingbao zhiyuan} for timely organizing of activities such as follow-up mine laying $\\{ h o u x u b u l e i \\}$ and submarine ambush and roving/hunting {qianting shefu, youlie}.

During sustained blockade of air lines of communication {kongzhong jiaotongxian}, [the JCC and command organ] should organize IO reconnaissance strengths to complement the other reconnaissance strengths in timely ascertaining the attributes $\\{ s h u x i n g \\}$ and quantity of aerial vehicles {hangkongqi} entering our no-fly areas {jinfeiqu} and their adjacent air zones, to provide target intelligence for the aviation forces and surface-to-air missile [SAM] units {dikong daodan budui}; [end of page 287] and [they should] organize information attack strengths to conduct jamming and suppression of the information systems of enemy-nature {\u654c\u6027 dixing} aerial vehicles entering the no-fly areas, so as to assist-support and complement our aviation forces and SAM units in driving them away, forcing their landing, and intercepting and striking at them. When conducting sustained sabotage of important targets on the enemy-held islands, [the JCC and command organ] should organize information attack strengths in jamming, destroying, or sabotaging the enemy\u2019s important information system targets, to assist-support the strike activities of the Second Artillery Corps and of the naval and Air Force aviation forces {hai, kongjun hangkongbing}. In the sustained blockade phase, [the JCC and command organ] also should, based on operational needs and requirements, apply network attack means to execute attacks against the network systems of the enemy\u2019s counter-blockade operational SoS; uninterruptedly exploit various types of public opinion propaganda means and PSYWAR weapons to execute psychological attacks against the enemy, demonstrate our military\u2019s operational will and resolve, and induce anti-war [sentiment] and war-weariness {fanzhan he yanzhan qingxu} in the enemy military and civilians; and thoroughly organize information defense activities with our important information system targets as the key points. # IV. IO activities in the phase of concluding the campaign\u2026288 When concluding the campaign in a blockade campaign, the JCC and his command organ should continue to thoroughly organize IO activities, to timely provide assisting support for our blockade force-strengths in safe withdrawal from the blockade sea and air zones or when shifting into a new campaign pattern. When the blockade force-strengths withdraw from the battlefield, [the JCC and command organ] should organize IO reconnaissance to complement the other reconnaissance strengths in rigorous surveillance of the movements {dongxiang} of enemy ships and aircraft, to guard against enemy surprise raids $\\{ t u r a n x i j i \\}$ , and organize information attack strengths for key point jamming and suppression of enemy airborne and shipborne radar and command guidance communication {zhihui yindao tongxin}, so as to screen the blockade force-strengths in safely and swiftly withdrawing from the blockade operational area. When necessary, [they must] synthetically apply multiple means to create the false impression {\u5047\u8c61 jiaxiang} that our blockade force-strengths are continuing to be present in the blockade sea and air zones, so as to deceive and confuse the enemy. At the same time, [they should] strengthen examination of the news [media] $\\{ x i n w e n s h e n c h a \\}$ , and strictly control the scope and mode of broadcasts of operational information, to ensure the security and secrecy {anquan baomi} of the operational information. When preparing to shift into another campaign pattern, they should swiftly readjust the missions and disposition {tiaozheng\u2026 renwu he bushu} of the IO strengths, and do a good job of the next phase\u2019s IO preparations, to create the conditions for accomplishing the new campaign missions.

Within an island offensive campaign, in order to maintain the campaign initiative $\\{ z h u d o n g \\}$ , the engaging sides {jiaozhan shuangfang} will widely apply information operations [IO] means to first seize information dominance {zhixinxiquan}. Island offensive operations under informationized conditions {xinxihua tiaojianxia} will be carried out within a complex electromagnetic [EM] environment {dianci huanjing}; IO will infiltrate into every field $\\{ l i n g y u \\}$ and every direction of the campaign, and not only will be the guide {\u5148\u5bfc xiandao} for the campaign, but also will penetrate from the beginning to the end of the campaign. Seizing information dominance will have important significance for seizing and maintaining air dominance/supremacy {zhikongquan} and sea dominance {zhihaiquan} in the island offensive campaign, and even for seizing the initiative {zhudongquan} and ultimate victory in the entire campaign.

Over the past 97 years, the military and civilians have worked hand in hand to overcome difficulties, and the military and civilians have worked together to build the Great Wall of Steel, winning great victories one after another. Promoting the modernization of national defense and the military is a common cause of the entire Party, the entire military, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country. In the new era, the key to consolidating and improving the integrated national strategic system and capabilities is to work hard on integration and maximize national strategic capabilities. It is necessary to adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, strengthen the integrated integration of strategic layouts in various fields, the integrated integration of strategic resources, and the integrated use of strategic forces, and systematically improve our country's overall strength to respond to strategic risks, safeguard strategic interests, and achieve strategic goals; it is necessary to coordinate the overall situation and highlight key points , driving overall advancement with key breakthroughs. In the new era, we have vigorously improved our capabilities for independent innovation in national defense science and technology and promoted high-level scientific and technological independence and self-reliance; we have strengthened the overall planning and construction of major infrastructure and improved the level of joint construction, sharing and sharing; we have held a symposium to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Yan'an Double Support Movement to promote dual support work in the new era.

On the one hand, in initial encounters with the Chinese\u2014especially in the early 1970s, when the normalization process began\u2014most U.S. officials were impressed with the cultured dignity, discipline, and purposefulness of senior PRC officials. And virtually all Americans who have dealt with the PRC have found their Chinese counterparts to be personally attractive and highly competent individuals to whom it is easy to relate at a human level. In short, Americans are susceptible to the blandishments of official \"friendships\" as the Chinese develop them; they are responsive in varying degrees to the games of guanxi. On the other hand, these same officials describe the negative aspects of their negotiating experiences with considerable frustration. To paraphrase their reactions: The Chinese are always lecturing us, presuming that their policies are without doubt correct, while ours are deficient. They assume they have the right to tell us how to run our affairs. They show no hesitation in criticizing the United States and its policies, yet they are self-righteously defensive about any criticism of their own positions. Indeed, for some reason, Americans find it hard to criticize them in the same manner that they criticize us. The Chinese are always getting us to come to them, to negotiate on their home territory and on their terms; they do not send their leaders and negotiating teams to the United States on a reciprocal basis. The Chinese are remarkably effective in setting a negotiating agenda that serves their purposes and in controlling the timing of the process. They are never satisfied with an agreement, and they never show gratitude for our concessions to their positions; and once an agreement is reached, they invariably press us with additional demands. These are familiar complaints that reveal the degree to which PRC officials have been able to control the ambience of the negotiating process. And while this is not to say that the United States has been unable to attain its own objectives through negotiations with PRC counterparts, the Chinese have been efective in imparting at least the impression of a no-win quality to certain aspects of the process. The Chinese try to control the negotiating process by sustaining an air of tension or uncertainty about the relationship. They try to develop a mindset in American officials that the United States \"needs\" the PRC, while implying that the United States has not been a good \"friend of China,\"'that it has not done enough for the relationship, that its policies or actions are either in error or deficient, and that it must do more\u2014on PRC terms\u2014to sustain Chinese good will and cooperation. # THE OBJECTIVE OF A NEGOTIATING COUNTERSTRATEGY AND TACTICS: CONTROLLING THE PROCESS IN THE SERVICE OF U.S. POLICY OBJECTIVES The instinctive American reaction to Chinese manipulation of the negotiating relationship is to try to resolve the tension and frustrations of the games of guanxi\u2014to either be a good friend or walk away in anger or disgust at the frustrations of the \"friendship\" manipulations. The American negotiator, as the representative of a technologically oriented, problem-solving culture, wants to eliminate issues, resolve problems, and get on with new challenges. The Chinese negotiator, in contrast, comes from a less-activist cultural background, one which sees management of human relationships as the essence of politics. He assumes that tension and conflicts of interest are enduring aspects of political life requiring skilful and unrelenting management. This difference in political orientation (explored in more detail in the last section of this chapter) is the basis for the conflict in the approaches of the two cultures to the negotiating process. If the United States is to be more effective in dealings with the Chinese, it must key in on this contrast in orientation. The objective of a negotiating counterstrategy must be not only to reach agreements consonant with American interests, but to gain control of the dynamics, the rhythm, and stratagems of the friendship game as they are expressed in the negotiating process. U.S. management of the relationship must convey to the Chinese an impression of competence in controlling the mechanics of negotiating encounters, an ability to deflect or set limits on their stratagems in the service of reconciling conflicting interests and attaining shared policy objectives. An effective strategy and competent negotiating tactics may make only a marginal difference in the outcome of a bargaining encounter\u2014\u2014nations do not generally conclude agreements that appear not to serve their interests. And a purposeful strategy, if overplayed, can induce distrust or the sense of a game being played simply for the sake of manipulation. Conversely, the absence of an adequate counterstrategy is likely to elicit an attitude of disparagement or scorn for a feckless negotiating counterpart. An effectively managed strategy, even one that thwarts Chinese manipulations, can develop a sense of respect for a competent negotiating counterpart. This is the objective that underlies the following exploration of negotiating counterstrategies and tactics. # STRATEGIES OF INTERDEPENDENCE, OR AUTONOMY? In Western practice, nations approach each other as autonomous, equal, and sovereign political entities; but in fact, differences in power\u2014based on resources, geographical position, and national pretensions\u2014lead them to establish hierarchical patterns of policy influence, if not formal alliances, in which one member is in a predominant position. Coalitions of equals, while not unheard of, are more the exception than the rule. Present-day France and West Germany, perhaps, can be viewed as relatively equal partners within the larger NATO coalition, with the strongly independence-minded French struggling to maintain their autonomy while seeking to benefit from the security and economic benefits of the alliance and the Economic Community. Beijing's approach to international relations is rooted, as noted at the outset of this study, in the tradition of the imperial tribute system, in which China, as the dominant culture and political power in East Asia, exercised preeminent influence over smaller tributary kingdoms such as Korea and Vietnam. This experience reflects, of course, the dependency/domination pattern fundamental to China's political culture, as we have explored it in terms of the relationship game and its influence on PRC negotiating behavior. Even in China's twentieth-century foreign relations, the pattern of subordination and predominance is evident. This pattern in the PRC's relations with its international partners (the Soviet Union, Albania, and the United States) in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s is shown in Table 3.

The key issue is whether we should allow ourselves (however consciously) to be drawn into the relationship game as the Chinese practice it, establish a measure of interdependence with the PRC, or develop a more autonomous pattern that is consonant with American political institutions and practices. # ASYMMETRIES IN THE AMERICAN AND CHINESE POLITICAL CULTURES This study is an assessment of Chinese negotiating behavior, not U.S. negotiating behavior; yet the record of American dealings with the Chinese says as much about the American political style as it does about the Chinese. Negotiating, after al, is a \"binary\" process involving the interacting styles and policy concerns of the two sides. Therefore, it is important to highlight some of the stylistic differences between the United States and the PRC that seem to have had a significant impact on the negotiating process. (See Table 4.) Effective negotiating behavior requires, among other skills, selfawareness of how one's own style and the institutions of one's government are interpreted by the counterpart. It can be argued that some of the major constraints on effective American negotiating performance in dealing with the Chinese are personality quirks of the negotiators and institutional patterns unique to the American system, not Chinese skill in managing the negotiating process. We emphasize that the following interpretation is intended to be suggestive only, to heighten the self-awareness of U.S. negotiating officials. It is not based on any systematic assessment of American negotiating performance and political style.2 Table 4 Asymmetries in the Chinese and American Political Cultures <html><body><table><tr><td>Category</td><td>China</td><td>United States</td><td>Significance</td></tr><tr><td>World outlook</td><td>Defensive, indrawing</td><td>Expansive, out- going</td><td>Scope of issues</td></tr><tr><td>Time perspective</td><td>Long-term, historical, passive</td><td>Short-term, future-oriented, active</td><td>Degree of policy continuity</td></tr><tr><td>Interpersonal re- lations</td><td>Group-oriented, empathetic</td><td>Individualistic, sympathetic</td><td>Enticement tactics</td></tr><tr><td>Approach to confict Controlling,</td><td>factional</td><td>Managing, coalitional</td><td>Pressure tactics</td></tr><tr><td>Political/ bureau- cratic structure</td><td>Centralized, hierarchical, disciplined</td><td>Decentralized, collegial, weakly disciplined</td><td>Pace of decision- making, continuity, degree of discipline</td></tr><tr><td>Information man- agement</td><td>Take in\u2014don&#x27;t give out, symbolic</td><td>informative</td><td>Take in\u2014give out, Style of argumenta- tion</td></tr><tr><td>Decisionmaking</td><td>Individual or bureaucratic convergence, &quot;principled&quot;</td><td>Consensual, compromising, functional</td><td>Style of agreement</td></tr></table></body></html> # World Outlook Americans and Chinese both approach international issues from the perspective of a great power. Developments in virtually allregions of the world are seen as relevant to their security interests, political concerns, and economic development. Elites in both countries assume that history and the weight of their influence destine them for a leadership role in world affairs. For the Chinese, this great-power leadership impulse has been expressed since the founding of the PRC, first in assertiveness within the International Communist Movement during the 1950s, which the Soviets found so galling; then in assertions during the 1960s that Mao Zedong's policies were appropriate to revolutions throughout the world; and most recently, in Beijing's efforts to speak as a leader of the nations of the Third World. There are significant differences, however, in Chinese and American orientations to dealings with the outside world. U.S. officials approach foreign relations with the expansive and relatively optimistic perspective that has been fundamental to the American national experience. While the world presents threats and challenges, the United States\u2014by virtue of its power and the self-confidence of its multinational population\u2014has been able for the most part to cope successfully with and benefit from its dealings with other nations. (Exceptions are its experiences in Korea and Vietnam.) The Chinese, in contrast, approach foreign affairs from the perspective of a peasant society with a distinctive and homogeneous culture that has flourished over five millennia of continuous history as a selfcontained civilization. Moreover, China's \"recent\"contact with the outside world\u2014i.e., since the early 180os\u2014has been an experience of unsuccessful efforts to fend off unwanted foreign military and cultural intrusions, and frustrating efforts in the twentieth century to adapt its ancient culture, political order, and economy to Western practices.", "metadata": "PRC Negotiating Behavior 1995 RAND.md", "judgement": true}, "33": {"text": "The Kosovo War pushed IO toward a new development phase. During the Kosovo War, the US military, besides applying traditional EW means, also widely employed a good many new-concept weapons {xin gainian wuqi} to execute crushing strikes {huimiexing daji} on the information systems and electric power systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] {\u5357\u8054\u76df nan lian meng}. For example, it repeatedly used conventional EM pulse bombs [E-bombs] {dianci maichong dan}, leading to \u201clarge-area paralysis\u201d of the FRY\u2019s electronic information systems. The US military also for the first time used carbon-fiber graphite bombs {tan xianwei shimo zhadan} to specially strike at and sabotage the FRY\u2019s electric power systems. After this type of bomb exploded in the air, it could produce large quantities of long thin carbonfiber strips; once these strips fell onto high-voltage transmission lines or transformers, they could create short-circuits, and thus incinerate the power transmission equipment and paralyze the electric power system. It is thus clear that new-concept weapons became a new means of EW. In [the history of] human war, the Kosovo War was the first large-scale war reported over the Internet {hulianwang}. As soon as the war began, NATO exploited the Internet, and repeatedly at great length {\u8fde\u7bc7\u7d2f\u724d lianpian leidu} reported the so-called true state of the war $\\{ z h a n z h e n g z h e n x i a n g \\}$ , to prepare the public {\u9e23\u9523\u5f00\u9053 mingluo kaidao} for the war\u2019s actions $\\{ x i n g j i n g \\}$ . Simultaneously with this, the FRY, in order to counterattack {fanji} NATO\u2019s propaganda warfare, also exploited Internet sites {zhandian} to constantly transmit its own voice to the entire world. Via the Internet, it in good time transmitted NATO\u2019s savage acts {baoxing} in the war onto networks, and sent out reconnaissance information consistent with the identifying characteristics {shibie biaoshi} of its information and intelligence systems. [end of page 39] At the same time, the FRY fabricated its own battlefield information and projected false intelligence {jiaqingbao} to deceive the coming enemy. The FRY military also fully exploited NATO\u2019s abundant Internet information resources, over the \u2018Net collected information resources on the weapons and equipment of all NATO nations which participated in the air raid activities, and thus provided powerful assisting support $\\{ z h i y u a n \\}$ for its anti-air raid operations. In addition, ever since NATO had first launched air raids against the FRY, NATO\u2019s official website $\\{ g u a n f a n g w a n g z h a n \\}$ had constantly suffered attacks by computer hackers $\\lbrace h e i k e \\rbrace$ . Several computer warriors $\\{$ \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6597\u58eb jisuanji doushi} of the FRY exploited computer software, sneaked into NATO\u2019s server connecting to the Internet, and within a short time injected several thousand illicit pieces of information, which caused problems such as the NATO website appearing to be blocked $\\{ d u s e \\}$ and user access {yonghu fangwen} having difficulty. NATO\u2019s internal $\\{ n e i b u \\}$ e-mail system also was honored with hacker [intrusions], and every day it received more than 2000 \u201celectronic bombs\u201d {\u201cdianzi zhadan\u201d} of illicit mail. According to a NATO spokesperson who declined to reveal his or her name, during the war some of NATO\u2019s computer websites had suffered heavy losses {zhongchuang} inflicted by computer viruses {jisuanji bingdu} coming from the FRY. News reports said that FRY computer experts, under the assistance of Russian hackers, had once attacked into the C2 system of the US Navy\u2019s Nimitz aircraft carrier {\u201cNimizi\u201d hao hangkong mujian $\\}$ , and caused its communication to be out of order $\\{ s h i l i n g \\}$ for up to several hours. In addition, the US FBI\u2019s website and other government websites also suffered the attacks of hackers, causing several websites for long periods to be in a closed status {zhuangtai}. The great network war $\\{ w a n g l u o \\ d a z h a n \\}$ which broke out during the Kosovo War broke new records in the operational patterns within humankind\u2019s recorded history of war. The adoption of multiple means to implement PSYWAR was another prominent feature of the Kosovo War. The U.S.-led NATO\u2019s tactics $\\left\\{ c e l u e \\right\\}$ of \u201ctroops who subdue the enemy without battle\u201d {\u201c\u4e0d\u6218\u800c\u5c48\u4eba\u4e4b\u5175\u201d \u201cbuzhan er quren zhibing\u201d} already had its proponents {\u60c5\u6709\u72ec\u949f qingyou duzhong}, who fully recognized the principle of \u201cto take the enemy by force, first capture their hearts\u201d {\u201c\u593a\u4eba\u5148\u593a\u5fc3\u201d \u201cduoren xian duoxin\u201d}, and placed PSYWAR in an important position. At the beginning of April [1999], Britain\u2019s Foreign Secretary [Robin] Cook {\u5e93\u514b kuke} in a public address said that the FRY\u2019s First Lady Mila and her children had quietly left Yugoslavia and gone to another country. This sensational {\u8038\u4eba\u542c\u95fb songren tingwen} news was transmitted to Yugoslavia, and naturally played a certain role in confusing the people. This is because if it were really just as Cook had said, then it meant that Milosevic {\u7c73\u6d1b\u820d\u7ef4\u5947 miluosheweiqi} had already made preparations for defeat. On 27 May, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia [ICTY] {\u524d\u5357\u56fd\u9645\u6218\u72af\u6cd5\u5ead qiannan guoji zhanfan fating} inspector [Louise] Arbour {\u963f\u5c14\u5207\u5c14 aerqieer} announced that she was prosecuting for war crimes Milosevic and four other former Yugoslavian leaders. [end of page 40] This also was a new product of the PSYWAR cooked up {paozhi} by the leaders of the U.S., UK, and other nations. Its intent $\\{ y i t u \\}$ was unusually clear: to isolate the FRY leaders and to create in them enormous psychological fright {xinli konghuang}. When carrying out the campaign operations-research-based planning {zhanyi chouhua}, they considered PSYWAR content and objectives {mubiao} within it. At the start of the air raids, almost 100 personnel of the $4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ PSYWAR Group {dadui} $[ 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ PSYOP Group] subordinate to the US Special Operations Command [SOCOM] {tezhong zuozhan silingbu} at top speed were moved from the U.S. to Italy. Some [members] even penetrated deep into the Kosovar \u201cAlbanian Liberation Army\u2019s\u201d [KLA\u2019s] {\u79d1\u7d22\u6c83 \u201c\u963f\u65cf \u89e3\u653e\u519b\u201d kesuowo \u201cazu jiefangjun\u201d} controlled area, drew up {niding} PSYWAR activities courses of action [COAs] {xingdong fang\u2019an}, and conducted a multilevel, fulldimensional PSYWAR offensive $\\{ g o n g s h i \\}$ against Yugoslavia. First, they set up the \u201cNATO PSYWAR Broadcast TV Station.\u201d This group recommended that the US Air Force [USAF] dispatch 6 EC-130 aircraft. At an altitude of 10,000 meters, group personnel exploited the medium-wave and FM bands {zhongbu, tiaopin boduan} used by Yugoslav State radio and TV stations, and in the Serbian language broadcast PSYWAR information. Next, together with the NATO International Military Staff HQ {canmoubu} Public Relations Department, as well as related intelligence institutions, they joined hands to prepare PSYWAR propaganda materials and false information {jiaxinxi}, which they widely sent out to the mass media. In addition, based on PSYWAR tenets, they recommended strikes on susceptible targets $\\{ m i n g a n m u b i a o \\}$ , including the Yugoslavian president\u2019s official residence and bombing of the Yugoslavian electric power and water supply systems. In order to keep the Yugoslavian people from timely obtaining true information on the air raids and anti-air raid [activities], NATO before dawn on 23 April bombed the Yugoslav State TV station, and on the $2 7 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ it used missiles to destroy the TV broadcasting tower mounted at the top of the Serbian Socialist Party\u2019s HQ building. The main characteristics of IO at this time were as follows: first is that IO had become an important component of the joint campaign. IO had become the \u201cfirst gun\u201d fired in an independent phase of the joint campaign, even before the launch of the joint campaign\u2019s overall activities {zongti xingdong}; it moreover penetrated from start to finish of the entire campaign. This [point] had a typical embodiment within the Persian Gulf War and Kosovo War. Second is that IO technology had produced qualitative leaps: various types of IO weapons had emerged in an endless stream {\u5c42\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a77 cengchu buqiong}, and informationized weapons had become \u201cmultipliers\u201d of combat power. During the Kosovo War, the sorties into action {chudongde jiaci} by the NATO armed forces\u2019 EW aircraft constituted more than $40 \\%$ of the total number of aircraft sent into action. In addition, the \u201cdecoys\u201d towed by aircraft conducted air raids, and also acquitted themselves splendidly during the war. One new type of IO weapon \u2013 the EMP bomb [Ebomb] \u2013 [end of page 41] saw application in real combat. Third is the maturation of IO thought and the proposal of integrated {wanzheng} IO theory, as well as the establishment of the corresponding institutions. Before the Gulf War, studies of IO only involved individual efforts $\\{ x i n g w e i \\}$ sporadically carried out by theorists within and outside of the militaries of various nations; but after this war, they then became studies by the nation\u2019s leading [researchers] $\\left\\{ z h u d a o \\right\\}$ and efforts of practice. This phase of research on IO further deepened, and also further deepened studies on fighting methods {zhanfa} for IO. In 1992, the US Department of Defense issued DoD Directive {zhiling} 3600.1\u2014 Information Warfare {xinxizhan}, which began to study IO theory in key point based, phase-by-phase manner {you zhongdian, fenjieduan di}, and developed IW capabilities. The fiscal year 1995 US Defense Report carried out a delimiting {jieding} of IO, and the fiscal year 1996 Defense Report at fairly great length discussed IO issues. The US military\u2019s Joint Vision 2010 {2010 nian lianhe gouxiang} and its accompanying full set of {peitao} trans-century long-range plans $\\{ g u i h u a \\}$ for the various services and arms {junbingzhong} all at very great length discussed the importance and main content of IO. In 1993, DoD took the lead in carrying out structural adjustment {tiaozheng} of its directly subordinate institutions, and clarified the duties $\\{ z h i z e \\}$ of each department in terms of developing IO capabilities. In 1994, it established an Information Systems Security Center {xinxi xitong anquan zhongxin}, Joint Staff C2 Warfare Center {lianhe canmoubu zhihui kongzhizhan zhongxin}, and Joint Staff IO Bureau {lianhe canmoubu xinxi zuozhan ju}. The US Army, Navy, and Air Force respectively established the corresponding IO institutions, and issued the corresponding operational regulations {zuozhan tiaoling}.", "metadata": "2021-10-12 Lectures Joint Campaign Information Operations CASI_EN.md", "judgement": true}, "34": {"text": "The army must develop the capacity to respond to various security threats and to accomplish diverse military tasks, so as to be able to effectively respond to crises, maintain peace, control wars and win wars in all kinds of complex situations. International 2020.01 Fourthly, we must follow the path of an elite army with Chinese characteristics. National circumstances and military conditions dictate that it is necessary to maintain a certain size of our army, but the key is to achieve high-quality and efficient development of national defence and military construction. We must implement the strategy of strengthening the military through science and technology, and comprehensively improve the scientific and technological content of military construction. Relying on scientific and technological progress, we will realize the transformation of the army's mode of generating combat power, and strengthen the quality of the army's construction with informationization as the main symbol. We will actively and steadily push forward national defense and military reform, innovate and develop military doctrine, adjust and reform institutions and establishments, and adjust and improve policies and systems. We will actively push forward military transformation with Chinese characteristics, taking the path of informationization-led, mechanization-informationization- integrated development, and realizing the overall transformation of the army. 20. The basic principle of a defensive national defense policy will not change, but its contemporary connotation will evolve as the security situation and national defense needs change. President Xi has gained a deep insight into the international situation and the evolution of war patterns, and has keenly grasped the state of the nation and the military, forming the national defense policy for the new era. Fifthly, the maintenance of regional and world peace. Peacefulness is an important feature of China's national defense policy. It is a key feature of China's national defense policy. In the first three decades, the task of national defense policy was to strive for peace for a longer period of time and to postpone the outbreak of war as much as possible. In the era of peace and development, maintaining a peaceful international and neighboring environment and safeguarding the country's peaceful development have become the basic goals of national defense policy. Deng Xiaoping said that one of China's national interests is to eradicate poverty and another is to maintain peace. Our army should approach the international community with a positive attitude of openness and cooperation, self- confidence and self-improvement, peace and civilization, so as to make greater contributions to the maintenance of world peace and the promotion of common development. a survey of new chinas national defense policy Page 6 of 6 We should strengthen our strategy, be more aggressive, emphasize policy and tactics, and make good use of the first move and the initiative. The main features of the important ideas on national defense policy in the new era are as follows. Defense Theory National Philosophy and Social Science Academic Journals Database National social scienees Database 21 Policy Ideas. The White Paper \"China's National Defense in the New Era\" elaborates the basic elements of China's national defense policy in the new era in five areas: fundamental objectives, distinctive features, strategic guidance, development path and global significance. The white paper elaborates the basic elements of China's national defense policy in the new era in five areas: resolutely defending national sovereignty, security and development interests; insisting on never claiming hegemony, never expanding, and never seeking a sphere of influence; implementing the military strategic policy for the new era; adhering to the path of strengthening the military with Chinese characteristics; and serving the building of a common destiny for humankind. On the premise of adhering to a defensive national defense policy, we should actively adapt to the new pattern of strategic competition, the new demands of national security, and the new forms of modern warfare, comprehensively implement the overall concept of national security, give more prominence to far-reaching strategies, more to comprehensive gaming, and more to all-area coalition, so as to effectively carry out the mission and tasks of the military in the new era, and to move the cause of strengthening the military forward continuously. (Editor: Xu Yonghan) Thirdly, we must realize the Party's goal of building a strong army in the new era. The goal of building a strong people's army has different connotations at different times in history. The Party's goal of building a strong army in the new era is to build a people's army that obeys the Party's command, is capable of winning battles and operates with good style, and to build the people's army into a world-class army. Listening to the Party's command, being able to win battles and acting with good style are the three key elements of army building and governance, determining the direction of the army's development as well as its survival and demise. This goal must be in line with the current national cruising process, and in accordance with the new strategic arrangements for the modernization of national defence and the military, we must build a world-class army that is commensurate with China's status as a powerful nation, that can effectively safeguard national security, and that has strong international influence. Secondly, we insist on the unity of the defensive nature of our national defence policy and our determination to safeguard our national interests. Our country is a socialist country, pursues a peaceful foreign policy and adheres to the path of peaceful development, which fundamentally determines our unswerving adherence to a defensive national defence policy and an active defence military strategy. However, we must adhere to the principle of being bold in our struggle, never taking a step backward, never losing an inch of territory, and no one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruits that jeopardize our sovereignty, security and development interests. We must adhere to the principle of offensive defense, enhance the positive and proactive nature of our strategic guidance, and be good at planning and creating new opportunities. Fourthly, reform and innovation have become the only way to strengthen and develop the People's Army. The history of the development of the people's army is a history of reform and innovation; we have come to the present by reform and innovation, and we will rely on reform and innovation to win the future. It is necessary to deepen the reform of national defense and the military, reshape the leadership and command system, optimize the size and structure of the force, establish a sound system of military policies and institutions, and accelerate the construction of a modern military force system with Chinese characteristics capable of winning information-based wars and effectively fulfilling missions. Put innovation in a more prominent position, and comprehensively implement an innovation-driven development strategy. We will make great efforts to grasp theoretical innovation, scientific and technological innovation, scientific management, talent pooling, and innovation in practice, in order to build an innovative people's army. National Philosophy and Social Science Academic Journals Database nationalsocialSciences Database First, we must obey and serve the major goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Military is subordinate to politics, and strategy is subordinate to political strategy. Under the conditions of the new era, the strategic goal of the Party and the State is to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and national defence policy and military strategy must be subordinate to and serve the supreme interests of the State in the population and the nation. A strong nation must have a strong army, and consolidating national defence and a strong people's army are the strategic support for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in the new era. This major goal requires us to unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, insisting that we will never claim hegemony, expand or seek spheres of influence, and actively contribute to the building of a community of human destiny. Fifthly, we should strengthen the important strategic position of civil-military integration. Civilian-military integration is a way to develop the nation and strengthen the military, and it is the only way to achieve development and security, and to unify rich countries and a strong military. We must insist that our national defense is the national defense of all people, gather national will, exert national efforts, and promote the implementation of civil-military integration, accelerate the formation of an all- factor, multidisciplinary, highly effective pattern of in-depth development of civil-military integration, and strive to build an integrated national strategic system and capability. China", "metadata": "a survey of new chinas national defense policy 2020_en.pdf", "judgement": false}, "35": {"text": "The intertwining of ethics and politics generates both a moral and security imperative to correct those who willfully violate Confucian norms, which includes those who don\u2019t recognize China\u2019s rightful place at the top of the hierarchy. If the accommodation and education provided by the tributary system does not correct and convince \u2013 or even \u201care likely to fail\u201d - then war is the only remaining option to punish the stubbornly-ignorant and poor leaders, rescue the people, and correct the immoral conditions. In fact, \u201ccoercion and administrative control\u201d to promote enculturation was often ineffective. Even if nonviolent methods are preferred, the perceived superiority, moral obligation, and pragmatic necessity of the China-led, Confucian- based domestic and regional system very easily create the conditions where the actions of others require the use of force. Just as it is immoral to permit individual behavior that is contrary to ren , Confucian texts describe the tyrannical conditions that, in some combination, require interventions, or \u201cpunitive expeditions\u201d. They include \u201cdeprivation of peoples\u2019 livelihood, separation of families, murder, misuse of the criminal justice system , barbaric treatment of individuals , predation or stealing people\u2019s goods, terrorization of the population at large, and what is effectively internal chaos or anarchy\u201d. Interventions may also be conducted \u201cfor the sole just cause of rendering criminal justice for past crimes by a tyrannical ruler or government\u201d. Leaders or entire governments that violate Confucian virtues, rites, and practices have failed their people and proven themselves unfit to rule, so may need to be removed. This logic means that the conditions that make war just also obligate rescuing the people through nothing less than regime change. It could be argued that this is strikingly similar to classic revisionist intentions. The importance of deontological rights is not clear from the rules of interventions because the threshold conditions for tyranny focus on material issues such as \u201cthe people\u2019s material welfare and physical security\u201d rather than \u201ccivil and political liberties\u201d. They don\u2019t require or mention the obligation to provide conditions that permit or encourage the flourishing of virtuous character. Additionally, toppling a foreign government in order to uphold its \u201ccriminal law\u201d seems disproportionate \u2013 as does the suffering and destruction inflicted from the war needed to intervene. In addition to mistreating its citizens , Confucian texts list conditions that justify corrective applications of force including when another state is experiencing political upheaval , is in violation of the rules of propriety towards China , or is experiencing most any source of disharmony. In fact, the citizens would be so grateful for China\u2019s virtuous rule that its invading force would be welcomed as \u201cliberators\u201d. No different than most other ideologies, historical interpretations of Confucian views of war range from pacifist to being permissible self-defense to counter even slight violations of the China-led Confucian world order. However, a pattern of claims that punitive force is moral and necessary because most any dissent has the potential to become a highly \u201cinfectious\u201d threat to China\u2019s internal stability demonstrates the expansive and high degree of control China has felt it must have in order to be minimally secure. Such anxiety heightens the sensitivity to possible disruptive elements and fosters the perception that existential threats are ever present. This is further evidenced by the argument that resistance to China\u2019s moral rectification not only represents severe \u201cpotential danger\u201d but it also makes China\u2019s wars against those who resist punitive in nature. According to this logic, the failure of ren and yi \u201cto attain the desired [moral and political] objectives\u201d proves that nonviolent, moral options are ineffective so even preventative or preemptive war may be morally justified as a tough lesson as well as a necessary, last resort for self-defense. Punitive expeditions may help align state relations but not having embraced the China- led Confucian system is also a likely indicator that the people are fundamentally \u201cimmoral, if not subhuman\u201d. Thus, a properly-ordered status quo Confucian tributary relationship still requires China to maintain a high degree of control. The concept of \u201cpunitive expedition\u201d is strongly coercive and the characters for it, zheng or zhengfa , reflect this as they suggest \u201cconquest and subjugation\u201d. Though the Confucian worldview and underlying moral reasoning is rational and may be sincere, the low threshold for war does not demonstrate strong restraint nor is it consistent with Confucian ideals. The belief that ensuring a properly ordered world and social system permits using force not only to correct improper behavior but also to deter future moral violations is a rather expansive and intolerant interpretation of Confucianism. The same moral standards of behavior and war are also not extended to other states as would be expected from Confucian principles such as reciprocity. Furthermore, deliberate or not, the conflation of the \u201cin defense of others\u201d and the \u201cin self-defense\u201d just causes of war and of its moral and pragmatic incentives also obscure the actual motives. It may be that practical incentives are provided to help convince rulers to respect moral restraints but it also makes it easier for China to justify wars to pursue its interests. The standards and reasoning for righteous wars also have striking resemblance to Legalist and realist beliefs. For example, some Confucians have admitted that not only may the use of force be justified to bring state relationships into proper order but sometimes it may even be the most effective means of doing so. Also, Legalism and Confucianism both consider war a punitive measure that should be minimized, only used with the right motives, and with measured severity. While some Confucians admit that punishments are not only important but must be appropriately severe to be effective, some Legalist authors have \u201crecognized that appropriately severe punishments were important for maintaining order, but they also cautioned that harsh punishments prevented further violence only if the ruler refrained from using them out of anger or revenge\u201d. Still, the ruler\u2019s authority to engage in a war is presumably constrained because its righteousness depends upon the support of the people. Classic texts warn that self-interested reasons for war such as for \u201cvindictive motives\u201d , \u201cconquest,\u201d \u201cprofit,\u201d or any other \u201cpersonal gain\u201d demonstrate \u201cmoral weakness\u201d that could result in the loss of the Mandate of Heaven. On the other hand, wars with moral motives generate greater commitment to a collective effort and greater willingness to help it succeed. The importance of the support, loyalty, and obedience of the citizens, military, and ministers \u2013 even over \u201ctechnical mastery of strategy, tactics, and fighting skills\u201d at times \u2013 is explained using moral language but is also a pragmatic argument to convince leaders of the efficacy of the Confucian approach to address persistent problems of rebellious vassal states, aggressive external states, and untrustworthy bureaucrats and populace. Indeed, Xunzi saw the Qin Dynasty\u2019s successful rise to power using Legalist principles of \u201cproto-totalitarian social control\u201d as a direct threat to the Confucian model and thus tried to \u201cmake the Confucian Way seem more effective, and not just more admirable\u201d. Neo-Confucianism similarly evolved during the Song Dynasty in response to concerns about the growing influence of Buddhism. Assuring rulers of the utility of Confucian morality raises doubts that the system of beliefs actually restricts their ability to pursue self-interests. While force is considered a tool appropriate only for political purposes , even the legitimate objectives tended to be ones that specifically benefited those currently in power. That only a ruler who possessed the Mandate of Heaven had the moral authority to authorize a war and that it was not uncommon to appoint relatives to rule tributary nations presumably reduced the frequency of violent power struggles but it also made it difficult for citizens of China or tributary nations to challenge even a corrupt status quo distribution of power. The greater privilege and the supposed greater virtue of those in positions of authority restricts the ability of ordinary people to criticize, forget constrain, leaders who are trying to justify self-serving behavior that conflicts with the common good. The righteousness of using force largely depends upon motive and situational context rather than on specific rules. Yet it is not easy to disprove the veracity of stated motives, highly subjective interpretations of complex political problems, or the reasoning of what response is most virtuous. The lack of objective metrics to help determine the role of Confucian morality in the decision makes it easier for a leader to disingenuously claim or self-deceptively convince themselves of having virtuous motives. Morality is valuable in of itself because it upholds fundamental ideals of what behavior that affects others is \u201cright\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d but pointing out the pragmatic benefits of Confucianism in order to make the value of applying it to real world problems more convincing does not invalidate or diminish the legitimacy of its moral component. An important distinction is which benefit is the primary motivation for its use. That is to say whether virtuous behavior is done because it is right and for the greater good or because it is profitable. The compelling moral value of Confucian thinking about war is that it promotes a humane, compassionate, and harmonious environment conducive for the development of character. This should be equally available to all or, perhaps, it is more important and more compassionate to provide to those most in need. However, the description of the properly ordered conditions best suited for promoting the moral benefits of Confucian governance in classic texts resembles regional hegemony. Though rulers should not engage in wars for personal gains, ultimately, the benefits of punitive expeditions to restore a harmonious tributary system are largely material and are unevenly distributed, favoring the Chinese people over vassal states. The moral legitimacy of interventions does consider the opinions of non-Chinese people but the metrics used are biased and self-validating. Texts argue that the success of an intervention demonstrates that it had popular approval by the citizens \u201crescued\u201d from tyrannical rule and that third-party states demonstrate their support for these wars simply by the fact that China\u2019s ruler possesses the Mandate of Heaven. Thus, the lack of outright revolt by the citizens of China and the country it attacked validates the properly virtuous motive of the China\u2019s leader, proving that the war is moral and \u201can expression of legitimate rule rather than a means of establishing legitimacy\u201d. After a punitive expedition has replaced an immoral government with a Confucian one led by a ruler loyal to China, the morality of annexing it is based upon similar metrics of \u201cthe people\u2019s approval\u201d. This logic conflates the moral and non-moral aspects of the efficacy of force, creating the risk that not only does \u201cmight make right\u201d but might makes it morally right. Accordingly, virtue would be based upon power. Such a relationship between power and the use of force very closely resembles that of offensive realism. Taken at face value, guidance from the progenitors of Confucian thought provide a check on such potential abuses of power by emphasizing the overriding importance of virtuous interpretation and application of Confucian ideals. For example, Xunzi argues that it is the obligation of ministers to do what is most moral for the state and its citizens even if it requires manipulating, disobeying, or protesting their ruler to the point of banishment or execution. However, this could make it just as virtuous to manipulate the people in order to garner their support for a ruler\u2019s decision that ministers felt benefitted the state - including to ensure society remains harmonious when a ruler makes an unpopular decision. The potential for abuse is further exacerbated because this check on power is not balanced. Even in the ideal Confucian society, the common people and common soldiers are not sufficiently virtuous to be trusted with this discretional latitude. Concerns that a political-moral hierarchy based upon subjective conceptions of virtue may create conditions ripe for abuse are not unfounded. Though it is not clear who was really manipulating ideology for self-interest, it was claimed that the use of Confucian morality by rulers of vassal states to justify wars of \u201caggression and tyranny\u201d led to both Mencius and Xunzi emphasizing the limited authority to authorize war. It is similarly due to the recognized potential to \u201cdogmatize\u201d and use Confucianism\u2019s strict definitions of morality as purely \u201cutilitarian calculation\u201d that Daoism rejects virtues like ren. Bearing in mind that Legalism was a competing ideology during the Warring States Period, the seminal Legalist Shang Yang rejected Confucian moral restrictions as merely \u201copportune\u201d and \u201cexpedient\u201d.", "metadata": "dis_ch2_2.txt", "judgement": true}, "36": {"text": "The large language model analyzes a large amount of data through algorithms, identifies the cognitive habits and psychological weaknesses of specific groups or individuals, and then manipulates their cognition and behavior through customized information push. ? The \"Comprehensive Evaluation of the Credibility of the GPT Model\" report points out that the potential of the large language model to be weaponized and used in cognitive warfare lies in the fact that the content generated by the ChatGPT algorithm is a mixture of real information and false and forged information, which induces the user's attention and perceptual stimulation. \u2462 ChatGPT's generative algorithm strategy takes advantage of this human cognitive and psychological tendency, that is, when the information contains known and credible elements, the public is more likely to accept the authenticity of the entire information. This \"real and fake\" mixed strategy greatly increases the difficulty of distinguishing the authenticity of information, making false information easier to be believed. ? Generative AIs such as ChatGPT mix facts and non-factual information they generate to create biased, misleading, and agitational content to impact existing cognition, and have the initial offensive and defensive potential for psychological manipulation and cognitive deception. ChatGPT can disguise misleading content as seemingly credible and logically coherent content, and its confident tone further enhances its cognitive deception, increasing users' trust and acceptance of misleading or biased content. Compared with \"non-kinetic wars\" such as psychological warfare, information warfare, public opinion warfare, and cyber warfare, artificial intelligence cognitive warfare based on large language models has significant advantages in five aspects: concealment, efficiency, accuracy, flexibility, and destructiveness: 1. The concealment of AI cognitive warfare. Compared with physical warfare, AI cognitive warfare is more covert and difficult to defend. Large language models have greatly expanded the scope and depth of cognitive warfare, invisibly manipulating information flows to create seemingly natural false information or misleading opinions. Its concealment and extensiveness make it difficult for traditional information and cognitive defense strategies to work. The cognitive warfare content generated by large language models usually exaggerates facts, exaggerates panic, or creates hostility. It is difficult to be identified as false content under information disguise, and can quickly trigger public emotional resonance and chain reactions. Because the United States has the first-mover advantage of generative artificial intelligence, if it embeds the cognitive warfare content of large language models into its public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and information warfare against China, it will be able to take advantage of the United States' powerful \"water army\" scale advantage in automatically generating accounts and publishing content, and use large language models to... --- The algorithm recommendation mechanism embedded in the model and social platform and the penetration of social relationship chains realize active \"feeding\", large-scale interaction and forwarding. \"Therefore, the cognitive content generated in batches by large language models is embedded in the cognitive confrontation of psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and intelligence warfare as the \"raw materials\" of cognitive attack and defense. This potential scenario will pose a national security risk to China that cannot be ignored. The cognitive content generated by large language models is more interactive, covers a wider range, and is more likely to affect individual cognition. In the daily use of ChatGPT, users are very likely to be deeply intervened by the cognitive content of human-computer interaction and deep learning without knowing it, and eventually their accumulated cognitive pressure will overwhelm the existing cognitive structure of the brain. At the same time, the application of artificial intelligence technology has also made fake news and deep fake content more realistic and difficult to identify, strengthening the complexity and concealment of artificial intelligence cognitive warfare. # **Second, the efficiency of AI cognitive warfare** It is reflected in the cost-benefit efficiency advantage. Algorithmic cognitive warfare breaks through the geographical limitations of traditional warfare, transforming the form of warfare from regional, physical domain material conflicts to global, virtual domain warfare. The key advantage of algorithmic cognitive warfare is that it almost eliminates the direct risks of war. Algorithmic cognitive warfare greatly improves combat effectiveness with its high efficiency and low cost, and minimizes the direct risks in war. # **The third is the accuracy of AI cognitive warfare** Large language models and deep learning algorithms can analyze massive amounts of data and identify the psychological and behavioral patterns of target groups, thereby enabling more accurate information operations and psychological manipulation. Driven by large language models, AI cognitive attack and defense demonstrates the characteristics of precise perception, precise prediction, and precise calculation, achieving clarity of combat objectives and customization of content generation. Large language models accurately portray user personality and cognitive characteristics based on massive data sources and feedback content, and use algorithms to build a portrait of the target's value orientation and way of thinking and match cognitive attack and defense content, achieving highly customized and precise feeding of \"cognitive bombs\" and precise \"sniping\" of user behavior patterns, preferences, and opinion tendencies. # **Fourth, the flexibility and adaptability of AI cognitive warfare** ## **This is reflected in the iterative and self-reinforcing characteristics of AI models. The self-learning and optimization capabilities of AI models mean that they can continuously adjust their strategies to adapt to countermeasures. Through continuous selection, large language models can learn more effective propaganda methods to better manipulate the emotions of the target population and gradually undermine their ability to judge objective facts. The cognitive combat environment is changing rapidly, and the content generated by the model also needs to be continuously adjusted and optimized as the environment changes. First, supervised fine-tuning can guide the large language model to be more in line with actual combat needs when generating cognitive attack and defense content based on pre-designed training data and refined parameter adjustments.** Secondly, AI can define a set of reward models for evaluating the quality and deviation of model-generated content, and then use content feedback to guide the model to gradually improve the generation strategy and reward function, continuously iterate training, and gradually learn to generate content that better meets the needs of cognitive operations. For example, by changing word embeddings, by labeling and changing the understanding and generation methods of certain specific words or concepts in the model, the weight of word embeddings can be gradually adjusted to make the generated content gradually fit the needs of cognitive attack and defense. \u2460 # **Fifth, the destructiveness of AI cognitive warfare** The potential weaponization of cognition by the Big Language Model and its potential involvement in cognitive warfare significantly increase the destructiveness and lethality of information. The two-way embedding of algorithm-driven large language models and deepfake technology can not only be used to spread misleading information, shape and manipulate public opinion, but also deepen the rift between hostile parties and undermine their stability and mutual trust. The destructiveness of AI cognitive warfare far exceeds that of traditional propaganda warfare, public opinion warfare, and information warfare, and it achieves the goal of conducting large-scale and precise cognitive distortion operations without the need for human intervention. In particular, the continuously improved multimodal capabilities of large language models have greatly expanded the means of cognitive adversarial warfare, making it possible to use large language models to conduct saturation-based precise cognitive attacks on specific audiences and to use deep fake technology to interfere with enemy decision-making cognition. ChatGPT advances the intelligent level of false information production. It is based on the generation and recognition of multimodal data, images and videos, and can generate realistic false images and videos to commit fraud. ## **From a tactical point of view, once ChatGPT and other cognitive weapons are weaponized, the attacker can use its advantages of \"big data top ten models $+$ strong algorithms\" to achieve large-scale production and deployment of \"cognitive ammunition\", quickly saturate the opponent's information environment, form a powerful cognitive offensive and contain the opponent's cognitive thinking, and achieve comprehensive suppression of cognitive offensive and defensive situations. From a strategic point of view, artificial intelligence cognitive warfare focuses on attrition warfare and protracted warfare, destroying or interfering with enemy cognition based on artificial intelligence means such as large language models. Algorithmic cognitive warfare based on ChatGPT can invisibly weaken the enemy's fighting will and resistance in an extremely covert way. Algorithmic cognitive warfare uses the mode of attrition warfare and protracted warfare to maximize the impact on the opponent's cognitive stability without spending any military cost, and achieve the goal of \"defeating the enemy without fighting\".** # **3\\. Artificial Intelligence Cognitive Warfare: Text, Narrative, and Mobilization** Since large language models have the prospect of being \"generalized\" and \"weaponized\" on a large scale by countries with artificial intelligence technology advantages and used for external cognitive offense and defense, the \"weaponization\" process of artificial intelligence cognitive warfare has become an issue that needs to be analyzed. Specifically, artificial intelligence cognitive warfare includes three components: \"ammunition\", \"weapons\" and \"targets\". # **First** Information flows carried by text are the \"ammunition\" of AI cognitive warfare. First, ChatGPT is used to generate massive texts or information flows that exceed the target's cognitive processing ability or thinking comprehension ability, so as to achieve a state of content overload and information drowning. The cognitive warfare attacker creates excessive content and text that is difficult to distinguish between true and false based on the large language model, and uses the target group's cognitive confusion to induce them to lose their way in the massive text and information and fall into a cognitive trap. Secondly, once the target group falls into a state of cognitive confusion, the ChatGPT algorithm \"tailors\" an information cocoon for them, selectively emphasizing or amplifying certain information, while ignoring or distorting other information, causing the audience to have cognitive biases in their judgment of facts. After the manipulator creates an information cocoon, it will further solidify the audience's attitude, leading to cognitive bias and cognitive closure, and shaping a false \"cognitive environment.\" # **second** ## **Narrative is the \"weapon\" of AI cognitive warfare. Narrative is not only a tool for disseminating information, but also a core mechanism for organizing and interpreting information. Due to the limitations of human individual social cognition in processing information, manipulators can take advantage of people's \"cognitive loopholes\". \"Weaponized narrative\" plays a key role in AI algorithm cognitive warfare, and acts as a \"narrative bomb\" in the process of cognitive formation or change through narrative manipulation. Large language models have the ability to process massive amounts of data and generate targeted content. They influence the opponent's psychology and decision-making process by manipulating information flow and narrative methods, making them a powerful cognitive warfare tool. It can be seen that large language models can create and disseminate narratives that are highly targeted and contagious in a very short period of time, identify cognitive loopholes and emotional trends through precise algorithms, and generate narrative content that meets the expectations of specific target audiences, making AI cognitive warfare more effective in influencing the opponent's cognition and emotions.** The large language model can create and produce influential, infectious, and provocative event narratives. Third, mobilization is the \"target\" of AI cognitive warfare. The potential of AI in cognitive warfare is reflected in its ability to guide cognition and conduct propaganda and mobilization. The emotional expression of cognitive domain warfare generated by the large language model is manifested as explicit expression or implicit pre-embedding, deeply rooted in clear opinions and attitudes or vague cognitive positions, obtaining the other party's emotional recognition and empathy, and achieving emotional mobilization. ChatGPT generates false content and puts users in a high cognitive pressure environment where text and content are repeatedly exposed and repeatedly stimulated. The cognitive threshold and cost of users accepting false content will continue to decrease, and ultimately \"reversing black and white\" will be achieved. Users are continuously induced and manipulated in a high cognitive pressure environment, gradually accepting and trusting false texts and information, and their vigilance and critical thinking ability decrease. # **Therefore, the two hypotheses to be tested in this study can be expressed as:** # **Hypothesis 1: \u201cConfusing right and wrong\u201d** Artificial intelligence large language models are able to \"confuse right and wrong\" and shape cognition and thinking patterns by selectively presenting information and falsifying facts, thus having the potential for algorithmic cognitive warfare. Artificial intelligence technology has significantly enhanced the attacker's ability to launch cognitive attacks in cognitive warfare. The large language model widely mobilizes public opinion and forces, driving negative emotions such as suspicion, panic and anxiety to continue to ferment within the opponent, inducing the opponent's internal instability or even collapse, and ultimately gaining an overwhelming cognitive offensive advantage. ?Conflict in the cognitive domain aims to strategically exploit these competing functions and cognitive biases that limit the rationality of different actors in order to cause distortions in thinking and emotional representations and thus change decisions. The attacker conducts large-scale sentiment analysis and pattern recognition based on the model, which greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of the attacker in actively shaping the other party's information, psychology, emotions, thinking and other cognitive domain components. ?", "metadata": "CHN_Cognitive_Weaponization_Cognitive_Warfare_Artificial_Intelligence_University_International_Relations_Sep2024-2_llama-parse_en.md", "judgement": true}, "37": {"text": "The meaning of the latest \"Regulations on Military Political Work\" of the Communist Party of China in 2021 https://indsr.org.tw/respublicationcon?uid=12&resid=808&pid=1713 1. News highlights The Communist Party of China recently issued the latest revision of the \"Regulations on Military Political Work\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Regulations\"). It has been 10 years since the last revision. This legal adjustment related to the CCP\u2019s political army building and the party\u2019s leadership has once again attracted the attention and research of various countries. Since the \"Interim Regulations (Draft) on the Political Work of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\" was formulated and promulgated in 1930, the Political Work Regulations have always been the basis for the military's political work. They have been revised 12 times, with a total of 10 chapters and 74 articles. Political work is called the lifeline of the People's Liberation Army. It performs ideological, political, and organizational work, and is also responsible for the task of forging the soul of the military. [1] The following is a study and analysis of the meaning of the latest \"Regulations on Military Political Work\" of the Communist Party of China. 2. Security Implications The political work of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s military was founded in 1927 to imitate the Soviet Red Army. Mao Zedong formulated the system of division of labor among chiefs under the unified collective leadership of the party committee, which was the \"Three Bay Adaptation\" and became the beginning of the party's absolute leadership over the military. [2] In 1929, the Communist Party of China held the \"Gutian Conference\" to establish the relationship between the party and the army. Based on the principle of \"building the party ideologically and building the army politically\", it established the basic principles and systems for the party's leadership of the army and strengthened the party's centralized and unified leadership over the army. After the Gutian Conference, the \"Political Work Program\" and the \"Regulations on Political Work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army\" were promulgated, which promoted the institutionalization of political work and established the principle of \"the party commands the gun\", making political work the lifeline of the People's Liberation Army. [3] In 1930, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promulgated the \"Interim Regulations on the Political Work of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (Draft)\". This was the first \"Political Work Regulations\" of the CCP, which standardized its political work. [4] The People\u2019s Liberation Army of the Communist Party of China must be under the absolute leadership of the Party, and the highest command power belongs to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission; a political commissar is established in the units above the regiment level, and the military chief at the same level is the head of the unit, forming two chiefs Co-management. The political work of the Communist Party of China focuses on tasks such as party building, organizational work, political education, military manpower support management, and military propaganda. It constitutes an important factor in the combat effectiveness of the People's Liberation Army and is a fundamental guarantee for the party's absolute leadership over the military and the military's performance of its functions and missions. [5] It can be seen that the CCP\u2019s political work can effectively implement the party\u2019s mission and simultaneously grasp all the movements of the People\u2019s Liberation Army to respond to the rapidly changing situation. The promulgation of the \"Regulations\" this time is mainly in response to military reforms, which can be divided into the following three points: 1. The People's Liberation Army's reform system and corruption rectification actions to achieve the goal of strengthening the military. From the perspective of national defense strategy, in 2016 the People's Liberation Army of the Communist Party of China has completed \"Deepen the reform of national defense and the military\" and build a combat command system of \"Central Military Commission - Theater - Troops\", changing the Central Military Commission from 4 headquarters to 15 functional departments, and reorganizing 7 military regions into 5 theaters, forming \" The reform of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the main battle zone, and the main service construction\" has made the functional departments of the Military Commission, theater command institutions and service management agencies above the neck level, as well as military-level units below the neck level and the brigade, camp and company levels under the new system, the military organizational structure and The force system has been significantly reshaped, forming a flat command and accelerating the People's Liberation Army's maneuverability and flexible application space. [6] At the same time, the CCP internally promotes anti-corruption actions, investigates and punishes those who violate disciplines and laws, and improves military discipline to maintain the stability of the regime. [7] After five years of military reforms, the original \"Regulations\" were adjusted and the design and normative revisions were made from the regulatory level in an attempt to keep pace with the times and update the content according to the needs of the times to enhance the effectiveness of the PLA's joint operations. 2. Focus on preparing for war and improving combat capabilities. From the perspective of military strategy, Xi Jinping once pointed out: \"To be able to fight and win wars, the goal is to always be able to call upon them, be able to fight when they come, and win the war.\" [8] \"Regulations\" The party's direction is the direction of the PLA's political work. The central tasks of the party and the army determine the basic tasks of political work. It is particularly emphasized that political work must focus on preparing for war as the main task, and insist on playing a service guarantee role around the central tasks of the party and the army. In addition, the principles and requirements for organizing and carrying out political work during combat are proposed to ensure the organic integration and linkage of political work during combat and combat operations, and to improve the quality and efficiency of wartime political work. [9] In 2016, the CCP divided the original general political department into three departments, establishing the \"Political Work Department of the Military Commission\", the \"Discipline Inspection Committee of the Military Commission\" and the \"Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Military Commission\". At the same time, some functions of political work were divided into Achieving the goal of \"Military Commission General Administration\" includes adjusting the Military Commission headquarters structure and implementing a multi-departmental Military Commission system to consolidate the power of the Central Military Commission. [10] In addition, after the reform, the functions of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, which was originally responsible for the \"public affairs, procuratorate, and law\", were transformed into a \"staff service organization\", replacing the original \"leading organization\" and making the functions Toward areas such as party building, organizational work, and political education. In addition, the units responsible for the implementation of the \"Three War Wars\" have also been adjusted. In the past, the units managed by the General Political Department of the \"Three War Wars\" were transferred to specialized departments with division of labor. [11] The units responsible for the \"Three War Wars\" were transformed into professional and Informatization, in order to achieve the goals of military reform and strengthen the People's Liberation Army's joint command and combat capabilities, can it maximize the effectiveness of the \"three wars\", as shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Changes in responsible units before and after the military reform of the \"Three Wars of the Communist Party of China\" 3. Consolidating Xi Jinping's power by seizing military power. Xi Jinping took over as the leader of the 18th National Congress in 2012. In order to consolidate his position, he actively promoted \"anti-corruption\", eradicated all dissidents one by one, and created the \"Xi Family Army\". [12] In order to effectively and reliably control the real power of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the leader of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, emphasized in the latest Regulations the implementation of Xi Jinping\u2019s thoughts on strengthening the military, insisted on the party\u2019s absolute leadership over the People\u2019s Liberation Army, implemented the \u201cChairman of the Military Commission Responsibility System\u201d, and institutionally clarified the Central Military Commission Responsible for party work and political work in the military reflects the practical need for the Central Military Commission to fulfill its responsibilities of managing and governing the party after the reform of the military, so as to consolidate its role as the lifeline of political work. In addition, the review of the \"Regulations\" focuses on strengthening the party's leadership over the military's political work, and fully promotes the military to strengthen the \"four consciousnesses\", strengthen the \"four self-confidences\", and achieve \"two maintenances\" to achieve the goal of strengthening the military in the new era. [13] Therefore, it can be found that the revised \"Regulations\" continuously strengthen the party's leadership over the political work of the People's Liberation Army, and the party leads the party to ensure that it controls the military operations in all aspects. [14] Based on the above, Xi Jinping revised the \"Regulations\" to implement the rule of law for the political work after the military reform, control the operation of the military through political work, and strengthen the party's leadership over the military, so as to achieve \"the party commands the gun.\" Its main purpose is to consolidate Xi Jinping's power as a weapon and to control military power. Reference, trend analysis and judgment 1. One of the 20 major layout tools This article determines that the revision of the \"Regulations\" is one of Xi Jinping's 20 major layout tools. Use ideological education, laws and regulations, administrative management and other means to comprehensively manage the People's Liberation Army so that it can continue to maintain its leadership position. However, due to this impact on the original \"succession echelon model\" within the CCP, in order to avoid political Due to the changes in the situation, it is predicted that Xi Jinping will not easily step down as chairman of the Central Military Commission no matter what, and will continue to control military power and control all resources. This point can also be confirmed by the new \"Internet Public Opinion Bureau\" [15] established by the CCP. It is predicted that the CCP will continue to strengthen the control of internal and external network information, use the legal network as the party's mouthpiece, and effectively control the PLA's network. trends and the right to speak externally to control public opinion. 2. The People's Liberation Army is focusing more on military modernization and joint operations. The CCP's \"Regulations\" have \"changed and remained unchanged\". What has changed is: \"added and strengthened joint operations capabilities, focused on preparing for war, and adjusted professional division of labor. Everything is based on being able to fight and win wars.\" as the goal to ensure the centenary of the founding of the army in 2027 and the modernization of the army in 2035.\" What remains unchanged is: the principle of \"the party commands the gun\" never allows the gun to command the party, nor can it achieve the nationalization of the military. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army can be said to be a party army, controlled by the Communist Party (led by Xi Jinping). In addition, the expansion of the CCP\u2019s military power in the post-epidemic era is also worthy of our attention. The People\u2019s Liberation Army has intensively strengthened its military construction, adopted a series of formulation or revision of laws and regulations, built a complete military and political system, and moved towards running the army in accordance with the law and strengthening the army in accordance with the law, so that the People\u2019s Liberation Army Flatten the command, launch mobilization and general warfare in the shortest possible time, and continuously verify the actual combat effectiveness through military exercises, significantly improve the combat effectiveness of the People's Liberation Army, and move towards the goal of \"Dream of a Strong Army\" and \"Dream of a Strong Nation\", such as the 2020 \"Joint Operations\" \"Outline (Trial)\" to improve and strengthen war preparedness capabilities; the 2021 \"National Defense Law\" adds new development interests; the 2021 \"Coast Police Law\" adds new uses of weapons, etc. It can be seen from this that the CCP\u2019s active military modernization layout has aroused doubts and worries in neighboring countries and other countries around the world, especially cross-strait relations, disputes over the waters surrounding Diaoyutai, and various islands and reefs in the South China Sea, etc., adding more variables to East Asia\u2019s regional security.", "metadata": "Meaning of CPC Newest Regulation Military Political Work in 2021_en.docx", "judgement": true}, "38": {"text": "The new technology revolution represented by information technology brings the great development of military technology and the new breakthrough of combat means. The war of hi-tech attack based on informational weapons and equipment has stepped onto the stage of war. When Israel bombed the Iraqis\u2019 nuclear reactor, the United States attacked Libya, the multi-nation forces in the Gulf War attacked the vital points of the command and control system of Iraq, and when NATO launched air raids on Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War, it showed that hi-tech is providing more effective means for realizing military goals, and it was possible to avoid the major political and military cost that traditional military occupation had to pay. High efficiency brings the war of hi-tech attack. From the \u201csurgical\u201d attack in the 80s to the remote precision attack based on informational command and control networks and the confrontation in command and control fielding the 90s, it marks the essential change of the war of mechanized firepower to the hi-tech war led by information technology. Section Three:   Strategic Position of High-Tech Local Wars One, the Rise of Hi-tech Local War Is a Historic Leap of Development over Current War. The half century after the Second World War is the period of great change that is most dramatic in the development history of war. In merely 50 years or so, the war of human beings made its historic turn and breakthrough. In this period of time, the possibility of a local war turning into a world war was decreasing all the time. Local war became smaller in scale, and the war of human beings changed from approaching world war to getting away from world war. Meanwhile, under nuclear threat, conventional weapons became popular, again, and they were improved rapidly, realizing the essential breakthrough to the development of informational weapons and bringing about essential change to combat means, methods, and ways. The hi-tech war led by information technology became the basic means for military powers to use force, initially realizing another epic leap in the development history of war. After the Second World War, the newly born nuclear weapon, the initial informational weapon, and the mature mechanized weapon all appeared on the stage of war. As today\u2019s world makes its transition from industrial time to information time, in the practice of war, the positions of three weapons had major changes. In the local wars of the 50s and 60s, mechanized conventional weapon took the leading position. Though the missile weapon with information-restricted energy release had appeared, they were only used in small range and small scale. The form of war was of mechanized firepower. Nevertheless, at that time, hi-tech local war had started to form. The form of war in the 70s and 80s was in the embryonic stage of hi-tech local war. In the fourth Middle East War in the middle of the 70s, missile weapons became the leading weapons on the battlefield, changing the combat method of mechanized war; and tactical missile forces became an important part of combat formation. This was a local essential change of the war of mechanized firepower. Later on, in the Israel-Lebanon War in the early 80s, improved information and destructive weapons began to be the leading weapons, making another local essential change in the war of conventional firepower. In the Gulf War in the early 90s, the information weapon system with C4ISR at its core was widely applied in war. The integral combat based on computer networks became more mature, and the emphasis and focus of war were conducted around fighting for the control of information rights, achieving the essential leap from the mechanized war of firepower to the hi-tech war with information technology at its core. The rise of hi-tech local war is completed on the background of nuclear threat. Since the Korean War, war got into the new phase of war under the circumstance of nuclear threat. This is the first revolution in the development history of the contemporary world. Under the cloud of nuclear war, war began to leave the world war and get onto the track of local war to come back to conventional war and finally got into the door of hi-tech local war with the help of information technology. This was realizing the second revolution in the development of the contemporary world. As information technology develops and it has more influence on the function of nuclear weapons, the discharge of nuclear energy will also be included into information control and applied in the struggle over the control of information rights (such as the electromagnetic pulse weapon being developed). Nuclear weapons may walk out of deterrence and be used in actual combat. But this kind of nuclear war is the nuclear war included in hi-tech local wars, and its essence is hi-tech local war. All in all, the first revolution of war after the Second World War is the foundation of the second revolution, and the second revolution consolidates and develops the results of the first revolution, being more fundamental. The most historic turn of the track of war after the Second World War is concentrated on the leap from war under industrial technologic circumstances to hi-tech local war. Two, Rise of Hi-tech Local War Is a Reflection of Historical Logic of War Development in Contemporary Times The rise of hi-tech local war after the Second World War shows clear characteristics of the time. Looking back at the development of war, it is not hard to see that the development of war after the Second World War showed the major historic turn: from getting closer and closer to world war to gradual staying away from world war. This is mainly based on actual combat to the confrontation of comprehensive national strength, stressing both actual combat and deterrence. From the war of plundering and dividing spheres of influence by imperialist countries to the war of hegemony countries, to seeking influence and control, and from the war of higher and higher battlefield destructive capability to the war that stresses strategic efficiency. Their development personality is shown particularly in the developing cycle shortened; stressing limited political goals, controllable war size, small size, and the integral application of war forces while seeking comprehensive strategic efficient goals, informational combat means, etc. These major turns and characteristics of the development of war after the Second World War comprehensively showed the new demands of international struggle when the global integration process was sped up and the mutual dependence in international relations was deepened further, and reflected the new change of the form of war under hi-tech circumstances, the new adjustment of strategic values, and the new development of war guidance. This embodied with concentration the inner logic of the development of war. The war history several thousand years shows that war is the means of seeking interest, and in the process of fitting for political goal and interest demand, the form of war constantly practices the principle of survival of the fittest, producing the new form of war with a higher ratio of cost and effect. The contradictory movement of interest goals and the means of war and the efficiency principle of war decides the evolution of the form of war and the development direction of war. After the Second World War, local war becomes more and more small-sized, highly-efficient, and hi-tech. This reflects the inner logic of war. The rise of hi-tech local war after the Second World War is the natural result of the basic contradictory movement of today\u2019s world, and it is the product of mutual functions of various factors of international politics, economy, science and technology, and the military after the Second World War. The evolution of the international political and economic pattern constantly caused war and controlled the size and level of war at the same time. The progress of science and technology materialized into new military means and molded the war according to political requirements. The contradictory movement of the means of war and war goals brought about the birth of the highly-efficient form of war, causing essential changes in the form of war. The rise of hi-tech local war reflects the historic change the war makes in accordance with the development of the times under the social and historical circumstances of the rise of today\u2019s high technology and the progress of production. The process of the rise of hi-tech local war is the process of different countries and peoples seeking to use force to expand or defend national interests on the international stage that changes dramatically. It is the process of war fitting into the changing political scene with the help of the latest scientific and technologic results and new means continuously. It is the process of war getting away from the world war, developing towards small size and controllability. It is the process of the mechanized war in industrial times turning to the hi-tech local war in information times constantly. And it is the process of constant renewal of destructive means on a battlefield, constant expansion of confrontation fields, and the renewal of, and extension of war. Three, Hi-tech Local War Is an Important Phase that Links the Chain of the History of War Looking at the development history of war, we can see that the form of war has always changed from lower phase to higher phase along with the constant progress of politics, economy, science and technology, and culture of human beings. It has experienced the cold weapon time, hot weapon time, hot nuclear weapon time, and now the time of hi-tech local war with information technology at its core. After the Second World War, led by two scientific and technologic revolutions, the international economy, politics, and social life constantly changing dramatically, making the international interdependent relationships going deeper and the process of global integration developing rapidly. Any conflict and war may cause fierce response and shaking of the international community, and no country can hurt the national interest of other countries all the way and benefit itself. The form of war that tries to achieve its goal of war at all costs and seeks unlimited destructive effect is going into a dead end, contrary to the progress of the civilization of mankind, and it will certainly be replaced by more controllable and smaller wars. The rise and development of hi-tech local wars after the Second World War is the product that matches the characteristics of this social and historical condition and time, and it is the form of war that matches the phase of the development of human society. Looking at it from the social and historical condition in which the hi-tech local war rises, the hi-tech local war is a war of a new type that is different from any other local war in history. It is the military struggle and form that human rationality controls the scale of war when the military capability of human beings is enhanced at an unprecedented level. It is a war with the comprehensive characteristics of limited goals. The space of war is expanded without limit, and borders between front and rear areas are blurred. The military and non-military is blended into one, the whole enemy side is within the scope of attack, and war has become a contest of high rhythm of all time and the competition of minutes and seconds in time. It is the war conducted with all-new informational war means, and the control of information rights has become the decisive factor for the result of war. Hi-tech local war is an important phase that connects the chain of war for mankind. As one of the links that connects the chain in the history track of human war, one end of it connects the traditional war which appeared after the birth of a country, the other end links the war of a new kind with all-new intentions and extensions on the background of human social civilization that has had fundamental change. The several wars that have happened from the early 90s of the 20th Century to the turn of the new century showed that the form of hi-tech war with contemporary high and new technology, especially the new information technology at its core, has stepped onto the stage of war. Hi-tech local war is a war when human society has major changes, and it traces its evolution as it predicts the developmental direction of future wars. We should know that the major turn of contemporary war has not been completed, and there will be more profound change. From now on, as hi-tech develops rapidly, information production develops, the process of global integration goes deeper, the political content and violent form of war, even the intention of war will have brand new content, and there will be newer forms of comprehensive informational war. Four, Hi-tech Local War Is a Military Reflection of Production Means Changing from Industrial Times to Information Times. Hi-tech local war is the natural reflection of the historical transition of the civilization form of human society in the military field. The foundation of happening, development, and form evolution of local war after the Second World War lies in the change from the production of industrial times to the production of information times. The production of industrial times changes to the production means of information times, it intensified the unbalanced development of world politics and economy, creating the environment for the happening and development of contemporary local war, providing new means for military struggle, and promoting the major development of contemporary war. After the Second World War, new technology revolutions came one after another; the world faced a brand new change, and some countries rose rapidly because of rapid development of their economy and technology. Some countries missed the opportunities, and their national strength went down drastically. In particular, because of the difficulties in economic development and the chaotic situation in domestic reform, the Soviet Union collapsed, breaking up the pattern of two-poles, and causing a new unbalance and turmoil of international forces. The development of productive, new kinds of management pounded the old management system and means, and intensified the contradiction and turmoil of some underdeveloped regions. Meanwhile, new productivity provided new violent means for military struggle, and the change of human production means brought about the change of the form of war after the Second World War.", "metadata": "Science of Strategy 2001 (English).docx", "judgement": true}, "39": {"text": "The space operations logistics support department can set up planning and adjustingcoordination, finance, medical, and materiel and fuel positions.

The mobilization and support-the-front department usually sets up planning and adjusting-coordination, mobilization, and support-the-front positions, and is mainly responsible for mobilization and support-thefront work in space operations. # Section 3: Space Operations Command Activity\u2026171 Space operations command activity is the organizational and leadership activity carried out by space operations commanders and their command organs over the space operations activities of their subordinate units, in order to achieve certain operational goals. It mainly includes understanding and grasping and analyzing and assessing the space operations situation, setting the space operational resolution, formulating the space operations plan, organizing space operations preparations, organizing space operations coordination, commanding space operations activities, and organizing space operations comprehensive support. Of these, the core of space operations command activity is the setting of the resolution and realization of the resolution; these restrict and govern the units\u2019 space operations activities, influence and even decide the progress and outcome of space operations, and influence the smooth conduct of war. Conducting in-depth study of space operations command activity has extremely important significance. # I. Basic requirements for space operations command activity\u2026171 In view of the very great influence of space operations on local war under informationized conditions, and their very important position and role, ever stricter requirements have thus been put forth for space operations command activity. 1. Laying even more stress on efficiency The pursuit of high efficiency is a universal law and basic requirement of operational command activity in ancient and modern times both in China and abroad. Along with the constant evolution of the form-state of war, space operations already have become an important operational pattern in modern war, and in particular within local war under informationized conditions. Moreover, operations now assume the characteristics of short time segments and dangerous situations, [end of page 171] requiring that space operations command activity should lay even more stress on high efficiency. This stress is embodied in 3 respects: first is that space operations command decision-making must be timely. During space operations, operational information propagates at the speed of light; space weapons exhibit advanced performance, operate at extremely high speeds, have long operating ranges, and are not limited by national boundaries, territorial waters, or territorial airspace. In particular, space weapons are not restricted by terrain conditions or the atmospheric environment, so the operational tempo is accelerated. Hence, there is an urgent requirement for command of space operations to be timely; this means focusing on the enemy space operations\u2019 characteristics, rapidly assessing the situation, rapidly setting the operational resolution, changing when the enemy changes, and even changing before the enemy does, to strive for the initiative. Next, the organizing and planning of space operations must be rapid. The participating strengths in space operations are multidimensional $\\{ d u o y u a n \\} ,$ with mutual exploitation of other activities and alternation in their conduct; so organizing and planning are very complex, inevitably leading to long planning cycles. However, objective reality with equal urgency requires that the organizing and planning of space operations must be rapid and highly efficient. To this end, [commanders and command organs] should draw upon research and development [R&D] of integrated {yitihua} command platforms and the opportunity to use the command information system, lay stress on the organizing and planning functions of space operations, and exert effort toward R&D of an advanced space operations organizing and planning subsystem. In particular, they should strengthen the forcestrength calculations for space operations, with timely and accurate simulation evaluation appraisal, thus greatly boosting the efficiency and scientific quality of organizing and planning, and thoroughly changing the outdated status of manual drafting of plans. Finally, the control and adjusting-coordination of space operations activities must be efficient. Good decision-making and good planning alone are insufficient: if the execution of space operations in the course of implementation is not forceful, good effects similarly cannot be achieved. Hence, [commanders and their command organs] must reinforce control and adjusting-coordination of space operations activities. [This involves] a timely grasp of the dynamic situation of space operations, and when detecting that the enemy situation has undergone a major change and the battlefield posture differs from the original plan, with major deviations in the units\u2019 execution of the plan, they then must fully bring into play the roles of the command information system and modern command means, to timely readjust and adjust-coordinate the space operations activities, so that they are conducted according to the intent of our commanders. 2. Laying even more stress on a directed [focused] quality Space operations are operational activities for seizing and maintaining space dominance, their goal being to sabotage and strike at the enemy space operations objectives. Thus, command of space operations has a very strong directed [focused] quality. This is mainly embodied in 3 respects: first, target selection in space operations must have a directed [focused] quality. In order to see that space operations attain the optimal effects, space operations commanders and their command organs must meticulously select the space operations objectives, and in particular must select targets which have a huge influence on space operations, such as strategic early warning satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, and space attack systems. By striking at these objectives, space operations can achieve very great success. Second, selection of the methods and means in space operations must have a directed [focused] quality. The targets of space operations mainly are concentrated among the early warning satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, and space stations; and since their technical quality and professional quality are very high, the means and measures often adopted [end of page 172] are relatively limited, so selection of these means and measures is very important. Several means can be selected for one target, and even a single means can be selected for one target. If the directed [focused] quality of the methods and means is not strong, the operational effects are certain to be poor, and will not be able to play much of a role. Third, the selection of the timing of space operations must have a directed [focused] quality. In terms of the space operations themselves, proper selection of the timing can increase the operational benefit and reduce the operational losses. In terms of other operations, since space operations often can lead to failure of the enemy command systems and precision guidance systems, and most effectively screen and assist-support the other operational activities, the selection of their timing becomes even more important. If the timing is either too early or too late, it could influence the smooth conduct of other operations. 3. Being even more particular about the combination of technology and tactics Space operations are a new type of battlefield operations and high-technology-intensive operations which emerged and developed along with the emergence and development of high technologies, especially space technology and IT, and their wide application in the military. Space operations also have catalyzed command of space operations, so that a technological quality and a professional quality are natural traits of space operations command activity. In addition, command of space operations is an important component of operational command, and, like other operational command activity, it has a very strong stratagem quality and tactical quality. Hence, command of space operations also similarly has the characteristics of a technological quality, a professional quality, a stratagem quality, and a tactical quality. In particular, this has put forth a requirement for even stronger emphasis in its command content on the tight combination of the technical and the tactical. On one hand, space operations need and require the brute-force bracesupport of technology. Space operations are dependent on the technical performance and tactical performance of space operations weapons and equipment, and the better the technical performance, the better will be the tactical performance. This also means that compared to command of other operations, command of space operations even more requires technical knowledge, and requires having the participation of a large group of personnel who understand space operational equipment and space operational knowledge. On the other hand, new technologies can generate new tactics in space operations. Today, a grouping of new technologies with space technology and IT as the core is rapidly developing, and regularly bringing about new changes. Once these technologies are used for military goals, they could immediately generate very many new weapons and new types of equipment. If these new weapons and new types of equipment are employed rationally, they could also generate very many new tactics, and thus achieve taking the enemy by surprise within the course of space operations. Hence, those serving as space operations command personnel and operating personnel for new weapons and equipment must, on the basis of a skillful grasp of the related equipment\u2019s performance, reinforce studies of tactics, to fully bring into play the operational performance of the equipment. At the same time, in peacetime they also must take care to track developments in space technology and IT, and, based on the possibility of technical development, study and forecast the various tactics which can be generated. In this way, they not only can pull the development of the technologies, but also can lay the foundation for tactical applications after the technologies are formed into equipment. [end of page 173] 4. Paying even more attention to mutual correlation Space operational forces not only can independently contend for space dominance or do so under assisting support and complementation by other operational strengths, and thus seize success in space operations; they also can serve as operational support strengths and fire assisting support strengths, to create good prerequisite conditions to contend for information dominance, command of the air, and command of the sea, and to provide assisting support and safeguarding support {zhiyuan baozhang} to other operational strengths for executing continuous strikes at the enemy\u2019s deep targets or war potential targets, right up to seizing success in land, naval, and air operations. Hence, space operations activities have extremely high relevance to other operational activities. Space operations command personnel must comprehensively consider the various situations within the full-dimensional $\\{ q u a n w e i \\}$ battlefield, and attach high importance to complementation and adjusting-coordination between space operations activities and other operational activities. If a certain frequency, a certain time, or a certain activity in the course of space operations undergoes change, [command personnel] should timely brief the associated unit(s), and correspondingly readjust the force-strengths and plans, so that the operational effects are interlinked and rely on one another for support, thus achieving integrated joint effects. If they do not pay attention to the relevance of space operations to other operations, that very likely could lead to a reduction in the operational effects, and even lead to the severe aftermaths of mistaken strikes and accidental injuries. # II. Main content of space operations command activity\u2026174 Space operations command activity is the tensest, sharpest, most important, most brilliant activity within space operations. Its content is wide-ranging, its coordination is complex, and its requirements on standards are strict. Only by comprehensively understanding all content of space operations command activity, and accurately grasping the critical links and important problems within it, can [space operations command personnel] steer the space operations toward success. 1. Understanding and grasping and analyzing and assessing the space operations situation", "metadata": "2022-08-12 Lectures on the Science of Space Operations.md", "judgement": true}, "40": {"text": "Then, at a meeting in New York City with Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua on September 28, Kissinger informed the Chinese that normalization was politically impossible during the presidential visit. Qiao countered by replying to Kissinger's inquiry about substantive topics for a joint communiqu\u00e9 to be issued at the end of the presidential visit by saying that his mind was a blank. This session was followed by Kissinger's strained visit to Beijing in October, during which the Chinese leaders sharply attacked U.S. policies, stressed their own self-reliance, and rejected all U.S. offers for small steps forward in the relationship. In sum, the Chinese sought to confront the administration with the difficult choice of either a \"successful\" presidential visit based on completion of the normalization process, or the embarrassment of a trip with no agenda, in which the world would witness a stagnating U.S.-PRC relationship. (This is what in fact occurred in December, although the Chinese warmed up the mood of the visit somewhat, in comparison with the frosty reception accorded Kissinger in October.) While the Chinese were not successful in pressuring the Ford administration into completing the normalization process, they continued to apply pressure on the issue by using an \"if you won't talk about A, we won't talk about B\" approach to agenda-setting on bilateral issues. The Chinese also showed great reluctance to put items on a public agenda that might compromise their relations with their allies\u2014especially the North Koreans, the Vietnamese (during the early 1970s), and the Khmer Communists. This was particularly evident in the spring of 1975 at the time of the Mayaguez crisis. On May 12, 1975, Deputy Secretary of State Robert Ingersoll called in Liaison Office Chief Huang Zhen and attempted to read to him an official demarche asking the PRC government to inform the newly victorious Khmer Communist government that if it did not release the Mayaguez and its crew, it would be responsible for the consequences. Huang Zhen, obviously acting on instructions from Beijing, cut off Ingersoll in the first part of his presentation, saying that the incident was an American problem and his government would not get involved even in the passing of a message to the new authorities in Phnom Penh. In contrast to their approaches to keeping issues off an agenda, the Chinese can be tenacious in pressing for inclusion of issues. This was illustrated, in extreme form, during the adversarial negotiations at Panmunjom and Warsaw during the 1950s and 1960s. Later, in the normalization phase of Sino-U.S. negotiations, the Chinese persisted in \"reserving position\" on critical issues in order to reach at least partial agreements designed to draw the U.S. government deeper into a relationship. # High Principles (Versus High Demands) We should not refuse to enter into negotiations because we are afraid of trouble and want to avoid complications, nor should we enter into negotiations with our minds in a haze. We should be firm in principle; we should also have all the flexibility permissible and necessary for carrying out our principles. (Mao Zedong, 1965, p.372) Deng Xiaoping: If the U.S.-PRC relationship is to grow we must have a common principle, regardless of what political party is in power in the U.S. (Deng-Bush, May 8, 1982) A counterpoint to the Chinese emphasis on cultivating personal relationships as the basis for a negotiation is their stress on negotiating from a \"principled\" position. Rather than initiating a negotiating exchange with exaggerated demands from which they retreat in incremental compromises, the Chinese will press for acceptance of certain general principles, and only after these have been codified and the negotiating counterpart's position tested against them over an extended period of time will the Chinese move to conclude an agreement. Henry Kissinger, among others, found this Chinese stress on principle to be quite different from the negotiating behavior of other nations. As he told President Nixon after his first encounter with Zhou Enlai, the Chinese \"display an inward security that allows them, within the framework of their principles, to be meticulous and reliable in dealing with others\" (Kissinger, 1979, p. 754). The Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 was the result of the first year of normalization negotiations with the Chinese. Kissinger recalled that his initial draft of the document, which highlighted \"fuzzy areas of agreement and obscured differences with platitudinous generalizations\" (Kissinger, 1979, p. 781), had been rejected as an unacceptable, unprincipled way to proceed. Rather, the Chinese pressed for a document that sharply stated areas of disagreement as well as points of common interest. While jolted by the unaccustomed frankness of this way of constructing a joint communiqu\u00e9, Kissinger noted that \"as I reflected further I began to see that the very novelty of the approach might resolve our perplexities. A statement of differences would reassure allies and friends that their interests had been defended; if we could develop some common positions, these would then stand out as the authentic convictions of principled leaders\" (Kissinger, 1979, p. 782). While the accumulated record since the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 was negotiated shows that the Chinese are not always meticulous in dealings with others on the basis of their principles, and indeed that they may reach agreements that actually seem to violate the principles they stress in the early phases of a negotiation, they nonetheless predictably seek to engage negotiating counterparts in a commitment to certain generalized standards or objectives that form the basis for the pursuit of specific negotiating objectives. As one student of PRC negotiating behavior has observed: In the vocabulary of PRC negotiators, goals which relate to longrange strategy are referred to as \"principles\" which must be rigidly adhered to, while goals which relate to short-range tactical advantage are referred to as \"concrete arrangements\" with regard to which they can be flexible .. . they concentrate on obtaining the agreement of the opposing side to the \"principle\" which they see as the main stake in the discussion, relegating to a secondary level of importance the \"concrete arrangements\" by which the \"principle\" is to be implemented. (Freeman, 1975, p. 6) Why do the Chinese lay such stress on principle? In some measure, it may be a reaction against the highly personalized quality of their policies\u2014an effort to establish a substantive framework for a political relationship and to minimize the opportunism that is inherent in dealings based exclusively on personal relationships and selfinterest. It also seems to reflect the Chinese need to know the political standpoint (li-chang) of a negotiating counterpart, especially a foreigner whose culture, political practice, and objectives are not clearly known and whose behavior is less subject to Chinese infl uence. Above all, the stress on principle at the outset of a negotiation is an effective bargaining ploy in that it forces the counterpart government to accept (or reject) a very general commitment to a seemingly unobjectionable standard of behavior\u2014such as the five principles of peaceful coexistence\u2014which can then be used to constrain its room for bargaining through the accusation that certain actions or negotiating counters violate the general principle. It also provides a lofty and inflexible standard to which the PRC negotiator can rigidly and self-righteously adhere while he presses his counterpart to demonstrate in concrete terms that he really does accept his country's commitment to it. In adversarial negotiations, PRC officials may rigidly put forward principled positions as a way of preventing movement toward an agreement. As Ambassador Jacob Beam recalled of his dealings with PRC officials at Warsaw in the late 1950s, \"The Chinese . . . committed themselves to dogmatic and fixed positions which were nonnegotiable. They rarely, if ever, changed their positions, letting them stand until they were obsolete, at which time they would substitute others equally non-negotiable\" (Beam, 1978, pp. 111-112). The negotiating experience during the normalization process was rather different, however, for the Chinese saw their interests served by reaching agreements and building a relationship with the United States. Yet the record contains episodes of Chinese \"principled rigidity,\" in which their officials have attempted to stall a negotiation or maneuver the U.S. side into accommodating to their principled position. For example, in 1978, as Beijing and Washington initiated the final phase of the normalization negotiations, Foreign Minister Huang Hua stressed to Liaison Office Chief Leonard Woodcock that the Taiwan issue remained the primary obstacle to full normalization, that the Chinese had been consistent in stating their \"three principles\" as the basis for completing the process, and that the Chinese side could go no further than its principled position in meeting U.S. concerns about its post-normalization relations with Taiwan.16 A few months later, Huang conducted a virtual tirade against the U.S. position on normalization in a long dinner discussion with Secretary of State Vance in New York City, stressing the various PRC principles that the United States had to accommodate to if normalization was to be accomplished.17 A foreign negotiator, of course, does not have to accept Chinese principles as a basis for negotiation\u2014indeed, American negotiators at Warsaw refused for years to sign a joint statement of support for the five principles of peaceful coexistence or to accept the \"principle\" that all U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Taiwan. Such a refusal, of course, communicates that the foreign government is unwilling to build a relationship with the PRC on Chinese terms. If a common basis in principle can be found, however, PRC negotiators can show considerable flexibility in the way it can be implemented, especially regarding the timing with which a commitment to principle is given concrete expression. Zhou said to Kissinger in 1972, in the context of a discussion of planned U.S. troop withdrawals from Taiwan during the year, \"It doesn't matter whether you carry this [plan] out sooner or later because we have already fixed our principles during our discussion.\"18 PRC officials more frequently invoke principles to constrain the actions of their counterparts in areas affecting Chinese interests. As the Carter administration prepared to enter office in early 1977, for example, PRC Liaison Office Chief Huang Zhen invoked the principles of the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 as a basis for criticizing Carter's election-period characterization of Taiwan as a separate country and for keeping the new administration's China policy on the same track as that of its predecessors: Huang Zhen: Frankly speaking, the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 constitutes the foundation of the present Sino-U.S. relationship and only if both sides strictly observe all the principles of the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9, then relations between our two countries can continue to be improved. Any action which goes back on the principles of the communiqu\u00e9 will result in harming the Sino-U.S. relationship. Vance: Let me say that I fully accept the principle of one China. ... Huang Zhen: So we have no difficulty on this point.1 Accusations of violation of principle have been the primary Chinese plaint in attempts to pressure the United States to end its arms sales to Taiwan. In 1978, as normalization negotiations progressed, and as the Carter administration continued to sell arms to the island, PRC officials responded to each arms-sales announcement with complaints that the principles of the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 were being violated, belying the administration's expressions of serious intent to complete normalization of U.S.-PRC relations. In the extreme, the Chinese are willing to challenge the basis for maintaining a cooperative relationship when they feel their principles are being violated by the other party. # PERIOD OF ASSESSMENT Negotiating with the Chinese is almost invariably a protracted process. The U.S.-PRC ambassadorial talks at Geneva and Warsaw went on for 15 years, through 136 sessions, with only one concrete agreement being reached before the two sides saw their interests served by political normalization. The normalization negotiations themselves, beginning in the summer of 1971, persisted for more than seven years. Negotiation of the joint communiqu\u00e9 on arms sales to Taiwan in 1981-1982 went on for ten months, although the issue had been discussed by the two sides for years. And American businessmen, accustomed to negotiating in a culture in which time and efficiency are valuable assets, learn with frustration that \"the first rule in negotiating with the Chinese is the need for abiding patience\" (Pye, 1982, p. 49).", "metadata": "PRC Negotiating Behavior 1995 RAND.md", "judgement": true}, "41": {"text": "They have accurately assessed the major opponents and directions of threat to our national security at each time so that we have been able to resolutely defend our national unification and territorial integrity and protect the modernization of our national defense, security and socialism under very complicated and difficult conditions. In the mid-1950s, as foreign forces led by the US strategically encircled us so severely that they could attack us, the Party Central and the Central Military Committee (CMC) knowing this situation, decided to make the southeast coast area as our principal strategic direction. Between the 1960s and 1970s, as the Sino-Soviet relations broke up and the USSR stationed a large army along the Chinese border to deter us more seriously, the leadership resolutely moved the principal direction to the three northern regions. In the 1980s, according to the new international situation, they changed the principal strategic direction again. Through timely adjustments, we have always kept our strategically active position. Section Two:  Striving to Accomplish Goals of Strategic Actions While Paying a \t\t\tSmall Price Goals of strategic actions are the direct political fruits that war wants to reap. They are specifications of strategic goals as well as the starting and ending points of a series of strategic planning and management including setting strategic guiding principles, drafting strategic plans, confirming strategic missions, deciding strategic deployments, selecting strategic means and organizing strategic support. Thus, deciding on the goals of strategic actions is an important principle concerning the whole situation. Deciding goals of strategic actions is an essential substance of setting military strategy. Clausewitz once pointed out: \u201cStrategy is the application of combat for fulfilling goals of war. Thus, we must set goals that are adaptable to the objectives of war for the whole military actions.\u201d Goals of strategic actions are the indispensable contents for planning and directing the whole situation of military strategy. They can be divided into general goals and specific goals. The former controls the entire process of the strategic situation and is the direct manifestation of political ends in military actions. The latter is the political end that each strategic stage seeks, each strategic strength and each fighting means must be separately accomplished and the decomposition and thinning of general goals for horizontal connection in stages of time and other aspects. Only having set the general goals can we make an overall plan and deploy the whole military situation as well as solve a series of important strategic problems including war preparation, military building and strategic guiding principles effectively. Meanwhile, only by setting specific goals can we base our general strategic attempt at dividing the steps and directions necessary to achieve strategic actions and enhance the objectives and plans of war to ensure that goals are fulfilled. For example, in the initial period of the War of Liberation, based on the general goals of \u201cstriking down Chiang Kai-shek and liberating the entire China,\u201d Mao Zedong had decided the general goal for the PLA was to eliminate 100 brigades of the KMT troops in five years. He then set a specific, concrete number to be annihilated annually for each theater. These goals had changed the ratio of strength between the PLA and the KMT forces and become the key to accomplishing the objective of war. Setting goals of strategic actions is the prerequisite condition for selecting strategic means. The aim of military strategy is to combine and unify strategic aims and means. Goals of strategic actions are the precondition for choosing strategic means; strategic means is the practical measure of achieving strategic goals. They are closely related, and both must be present. Goals of strategic actions are the direction and standard for choosing strategic means. Different goals need different means, or the same goal can choose different means. The key is that the two must be properly planned and managed. With clear-cut goals of strategic actions, the strategic director can change the use of them according to military situations, correctly calculate the problems of how to develop and apply military forces to avoid a divorce between them. Based on the need of the goals of strategic actions, he can improve targeting at the application, flexibility and adaptability of strategic means and accurately employ the methods of actual fighting and deterrence to form mobile and flexible strategy and tactics. In short, only being under the guidance of correct goals of strategic actions can the application of strategic means meet the requirement of political and military struggles. This will bring the efficacy of all kinds of strategic actions into full play to form a whole operational might and render a better service to the fulfillment of political objectives. Setting goals of strategic actions usually should meet the following requirements: First, the goals must be in keeping with the basic national interest. They are a specific manifestation of general national policy and objectives in the military field. Their setting must take the principle of maintaining and defending the national interest. In terms of politics, the most important goal is political independence, sovereignty integrity and national unification, which are the most fundamental requirements. In terms of security, it is protecting territorial integrity and ocean rights to prevent them from foreign  encroachment, which is the most fundamental requirement to guarantee the fulfillment of other national interests. In terms of economy, it must provide the most powerful insurance for the safety of national economic construction. It should fully consider and embody the needs of national interests and be subordinate to and serve the objectives of the nation\u2019s political struggle in a certain period of time, which we must strive to accomplish even though there are difficulties and dangers. On the contrary, we should not act rashly in violation of national interest even though the goals can benefit us militarily. As a socialist nation observing an independent and autonomous foreign policy, the goals of strategic actions must uphold anti-aggression and anti-hegemony and protect world peace and national security. After the Cold War, although the environment for peripheral security has been relatively improved and massive armed invasion endangering China\u2019s survival could be avoided, hegemony and power politics, however, still exist and are developing. Foreign and domestic hostile powers are ganging up with each other to be crazily engaged in splitting  China. The historically inherited disputes over border areas and ocean rights are not yet totally settled and the threat of war is not completely eliminated; thus, goals of military strategic actions in the new era must fully consider the above situations and thoroughly satisfy the requirement of China\u2019s basic interests. Second, the goals must adapt to international situations. Correctly selecting goals of strategic actions has the aim of solving the security problem that China is facing at    certain times. Having an accurate understanding of the international situation is to macroscopically grasp major contradictions and the tendency of development of the world. The world strategic situation is a concentrated embodiment of the growth and decline as well as diversification and composition of comprehensive national strength of various countries. Its formation decides those countries\u2019 function and position in the international society. The powerful countries\u2019 tendency of aggression essentially reflects the nature and demand of their economic and political interests, which is an important factor to understand the relations of those countries, especially between great powers, and to correctly assess the whole situation. The tendency of war in the current world situation is a big issue affecting world security and to find out the kinetic reason for war is the basic way to analyze the threat of war. Development and change of the situation of peripheral security is an essential condition directly affecting national interests and a side view reflects the core problems among our neighboring countries, such as the contradiction of interests, strategic attempts and military movements. Thus, only by correctly understanding the international situation can we go along with the tide of history to catch the major conflict of interest among the deterring countries and correctly select our principal strategic direction. We can be clearer and more specific about the goals of military strategy and also be more practical in our targeting. Third, the goals must be beneficial to accomplishing our strategic objectives. Accomplishment of strategic goals is an important symbol of fulfilling military strategic objectives. As a form of specific manifestation of strategic objectives, strategic goals must appropriately and clearly embody all indexes of the objectives to make them not only practical and feasible but also satisfy strategic needs. We cannot set the goals too high to exceed the normal requirements of national interest and the actual capability of military forces and cause them to divorce themselves from strategic needs and move toward the opposite direction. Nor can we set them too low to make strategic objectives unable to be fulfilled on time and bring losses to our national interest. Therefore, when setting the goals, we must make them clear and specific and highly feasible in order to facilitate the grasping and conducting of them in military actions and ensure a smooth materialization of strategic objectives. Fourth, the goals must be compatible with strategic combat capability. Armed forces\u2018 strategic combat capability is a fundamental condition to materializing the goals of strategic actions. Strategic goals cannot be divorced from reality and raise missions that strategic combat capability cannot accomplish. Nor can we set the goals too high to abuse the means of strategic combat, and even set them too low to affect the materialization of strategic objectives. The mistakes of military adventurism and military conservatism have given China\u2019s revolutionary war unfavorable lessons or even failures; therefore, in order to keep strategic goals in line with the reality of strategic combat capability, we must \u201cdo what we can..\u201d It means that we must base the reality of strategic combat capability on set strategic goals and select means for strategic combat according to our needs. We must strive to heighten the level of strategic combat to make it adaptable to the need and to closely combine the application and building of military forces to lay a material foundation for the fulfillment of strategic goals. Fifth, we must attain the biggest victory with the smallest price. On the selection of goals of strategic actions, we should foster the concept of military effectiveness and results. We should never pay a huge sacrifice and price for a limited victory and advantage; instead, we should minimize the cost and sacrifice and strive to realize our strategic goals with the lowest price as it is an important display of the strategic director\u2019s superb art of command. For this reason, under modern conditions, when setting strategic goals, we must base our plans on the characteristics of modern high-tech warfare to select vulnerabilities in the enemy\u2019s operational system and strike them hard. We must try to go for the favorable and avoid the harmful and proceed to the real and bypass the false and use one soldier as ten. Unless the nation is in danger of life or death, we should never fight a decisive war at any cost. Under normal conditions, we should not fight to overcome the enemy if we can do it without fighting or not fight a large battle if a small battle can serve the purpose. We must strive to use a small battle or create a momentum to cause a strong psychological shock to the enemy to achieve the consequences of \u201csubduing the enemy without fighting\u201d or \u201csubduing the enemy by a small battle.\u201c Section Three: Never Fighting a Battle Unprepared or Unsure of Winning War is a big fundamental matter affecting the life and death, honor and shame and gain and loss of a country, a nation or a political group; thus, we must insist on the principle of being careful with war and conducting it with extra caution. When facing the threat of war or military pressure, the strategic director must calmly analyze the situation and weigh the pros and cons to carefully make strategic selections. He must not despise combat and rush to conclusions nor be timid and indecisive. He must strive to closely plan and be fully prepared and strive to win the war when the situation is more in our favor. I. Closely planning and being fully prepared War is full of unpredictable \u201ctraps\u201d and \u201cmist\u201d and is more unpredictable and less certain than other societal elements. Never fight a battle unprepared or unsure of winning,  requires close planning and fully being prepared before any military actions. In the ancient Chinese book of war, the teachings of \u201ccalculating in the temple,\u201d \u201cthe way of using forces is to plan first and then take action,\u201d \u201cto fight an enemy and win a war should have a plan first.\u201d  \u201cThe enemy is always defeated when beating it with a plan.\u201d  All emphasized the importance of close planning and being fully prepared. Clausewitz, the famous Prussian military theorist, believed planning operations and demands allowed each common action to achieve this sort of unification. Napoleon thought that everything would end in nothing if not planned beforehand. In the long practice of China\u2019s revolutionary war, Mao Zedong used the viewpoint of material dialectics to profoundly analyze the probabilities and uncertainties in wars and pointed out \u201cdue to the uncertainties in wars, to carry out planning in wars is more difficult than applying it in other undertakings. However, things stand when planned and fall apart when not. We cannot win victory in a war without previous planning and preparations.\u201d  He summarized a series of logic of military knowledge and strategic guidance, from reconnaissance, assessment to planning and preparation, thereby achieving a maximum unification of the probabilities and uncertainties in wars and military struggles and successfully solving the contradiction in the planning nature of subjective guidance and the probability in objective reality. II. Being sure of both subjective and objective conditions Being planned and prepared is the precondition of attaining victory, but it does not mean that we are sure of winning. As Mao Zedong said, \u201cWe do not fight a battle unprepared and unsure of winning, and we can fight a battle prepared but unsure of winning.\u201c  In order to fight a battle sure of winning, on the one hand, we must positively prepare all material conditions for defeating the enemy.", "metadata": "Science of Strategy 2001 (English).docx", "judgement": true}, "42": {"text": "This interpretation also reinforces the claim of China's inherent peacefulness and respect for other cultures: \"China respected the culture of neighboring countries and was good at adopting the positive models.

Rather, Beijing is answering the call of a world embroiled in great turmoil. Countries are looking for ideas that can be used to solve their own governance problems while delivering \u201cfairness and justice\u201d and \u201cpeace and development,\u201d which are the \u201ccommon aspirations of all mankind.\u201d $^{205}$ Zhao Yongshuai and Qin Long depict the world as \u201cneeding\u201d and \u201cexpecting\u201d China to fulfill its responsibilities. $^{206}$ And because China has \u201calways stood at the moral summit,\u201d no other country is better qualified for becoming such a role model. Xi stated the following during a February 2017 National Security Work Conference: \u201cThe glorious 5,000-year history of the Chinese nation, the 95-year historical struggle of the CCP, and the 38-year development miracle of reform and opening up have already declared to the world with indisputable facts that we are qualified to be a leader\u201d that can guide the international community to build a new order. $^{207}$ # Calling for the Creation of a Community of Common Destiny Xi Jinping has come close to candidly framing his vision for a new world order under China's helm as a 21st-century version of the tianxia model. On multiple occasions, he has repeated his wish to see the world come together in harmony as one family under the same heaven (shijie datong tianxia yijia).$^{208}$ Xi usually associates this imagery with his vision for the building of a community of common destiny (renlei mingyun gongtongti), now translated in official Chinese documents as a \"community with a shared future for mankind\" (or for humanity).$^{209}$ He mentioned this concept for the first time in March 2013 at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations while describing to his audience the \"kaleidoscopic changes that make the world constantly different.\" In a world increasingly interlinked and interdependent, people, \"by living in the same global village within the same time and space where history and reality meet, have increasingly emerged as a community of common destiny in which everyone has in himself a little bit of others.\"$^{210}$ By the time Xi appeared at the UN General Assembly lectern on September 28, 2015, the community's \"destiny\" had mutated into a \"shared future,\" and its components were more explicit.$^{211}$ Xi expounded on the same themes during his speech at the UN Office in Geneva on January 18, 2017.$^{212}$ In a 2017 op-ed, the Xinhua editors depict the leader's vision as a game changer of the magnitude of the Enlightenment ideas or the theories of Marx. Whenever \"world history enters a critical juncture,\" they contend, intellectual visions are always crucial \"driving forces for human progress.\" The community of common destiny, which offers the world \"Chinese wisdom\" and a \"Chinese solution,\" \"draws new blueprints for the advancement of human society.\"\u00b2\u00b9\u00b3 For Hu Rongtao, a researcher at Xiamen University, this concept represents the \"commanding point in the construction of [China's] international discourse power.\"\u00b2\u00b9\u2074 Reflecting its importance for the leadership, the concept was mentioned half a dozen times in the 19th Party Congress report, and the PRC constitution was amended to include it in March 2018.\u00b2\u00b9\u2075 A compilation of Xi's speeches on the community of common destiny was subsequently published in October 2018,\u00b2\u00b9\u2076 and since its first articulation, Chinese scholars have been busily writing exegeses of the leader's vision.\u00b2\u00b9\u2077 Xi's vision for the community of common destiny is not modest.$^{218}$ Its goal is nothing less than building an \"open, inclusive, clean, and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security, and common prosperity.\"$^{219}$ This holistic concept rests on political, security, economic, cultural, and environmental pillars. These are the same five pillars that Hu Jintao identified in May 2003 when he delivered a speech at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (an interesting coincidence of locations). Hu articulated his vision for building a \"harmonious world\" with the same hope of bringing about \"lasting peace and universal prosperity,\" which he considered \"the inevitable request of human society development.\" In Chinese politics, if history does not repeat itself, it certainly often rhymes. According to Hu, full collaboration in five areas would help construct a harmonious world:", "metadata": "NBR-China_Vision_New_Order_Jan2020.md", "judgement": true}, "43": {"text": "Two other characteristics of the end game are worth noting. The Chinese will use the occasion of reaching formal agreement to \"tag\" for the future their position on the issues where they have \"reserved position.\" In the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 this \"tagging\" was accomplished in their unilateral paragraphs on the issues of Taiwan and various international problems. In the normalization agreement, Deng Xiaoping's final session with Leonard Woodcock concluded with Deng's assertion that the arms-sales issue should be discussed in the future (see the Deng-Woodcock exchange of December 15, 1978). And the unilateral public statement by Premier Hua Guofeng reaffirmed PRC opposition to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and the position that the manner of reunifying Taiwan with \"the motherland\" was an internal Chinese matter. It should also be noted that the Chinese have a preference for political agreements cast in the form of relatively vague expressions of principle and intent, and made public in the form of joint press statements, communiqu\u00e9s, or joint declarations, as opposed to formal treaties or highly specific, \"contractual\" arrangements. This seems to reflect not only a preference for the flexibility that relatively vague language affords them in future negotiating rounds or in subsequent efforts to press the counterpart government to implement the \"spirit\" of an agreement, but also their distrust of legalistic approaches to politics and the underlying assumption of the relationship game that good guanxi and a strong sense of shared interest are the most reliable guarantors of a political agreement. # IMPLEMENTATION The implementation of a negotiated agreement is not usually thought of as part of the negotiating process; yet the Chinese press their counterparts to an agreement for \"strict implementation.\" The United States began to experience PRC pressures regarding the implementation dimension of the U.S.-PRC relationship in the summer of 1973, when Zhou Enlai commented to Liaison Office Chief David Bruce that the relationship would develop most effectively if \"one keeps one's promises\" regarding normalization and opposition to the Soviet Union. More-direct pressure on the normalization issue was raised first in 1974, in Qiao Guanhua's low-key comment to Bruce that the recent appointment of a new U.S. ambassador to Taipei and the opening of two new Republic of China consulates in the United States represented \"minor problems\" in the relationship.144 The most intense pressures for implementation of the 1972 Nixon expression of intent to complete normalization in the second term came (as detailed earlier) in the fall of 1975. Yet the Chinese pressed Kissinger obliquely, with the threat of an unsuccessful Ford presidential visit, rather than by complaining directly about the U.S. failure to meet the Nixon time schedule. The Chinese were delicate in pressing the Carter administration to follow through on the normalization time commitment of its predecessor, 145 although, as noted earlier, they did hold Secretary Vance and National Security Adviser Brzezinski to the terms agreed to by President Ford.146 Once normalization was accomplished, the Chinese began to press on implementive aspects of the new relationship. While the Chinese posture themselves as self-righteous sticklers in overseeing the implementation of agreements, they in fact have a less-than-perfect record in following through. They reneged on the agreement worked out between Zhou Enlai and Kissinger in 1973 to resolve the private-claims/blocked-assets issue; and having agreed with Secretary of State Haig in the summer of 1981 to send General Liu Huaqing to the United States for talks on arms-transfer issues, they withdrew the arrangement with complaints about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. And in the spring of 1984, Premier Zhao Ziyang, in a discussion with President Reagan, laid the basis for eventual nonfulfillment of the U.S.-PRC grain-trade agreement. U.S. businessmen, in particular, complain frequently about Chinese failures to implement contractual agreements. With their penchant for pressing their friends to \"understand\" (forgive) their failure to follow through, as well as their inclination to seek substantial modifications of contracts once signed, the Chinese have not maintained a record for meticulously implementing agreements that they sign with their political and economic partners. # PERSONALITIES We have thus far described evident patterns in the way PRC officials attempt to manage negotiations as if the process were independent of the personalities involved. While this is true in some measure, inasmuch as culture and institutions tend to dilute the influence of individual actions, personalities can and do significantly shape both the style and the substantive content of negotiating encounters. In U.S. dealings with the PRC, two factors have tended to magnify the impact of individual personalities: the highly personalized quality of the Chinese political process, and the remarkable continuity of senior personnel in the PRC leadership that has given a few individuals enormous influence over the PRC's foreign relations. The formal negotiating record assessed for this analysis and the personal memoirs of the American officials who conducted negotiations with PRC counterparts reveal interesting variations in style among the Chinese leaders who managed the relationship with the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s. They also disclose interesting hints about the interrelationships among the various leaders, as well as insights into the state of elite politics in the Chinese capital. Our objective here is not to present an elaborate assessment of the personalities of the PRC leaders and senior officials who have been the primary managers of the U.S.-PRC relationship, but rather to highlight two points: First, the personalities of individual PRC leaders do influence the style in which the negotiating process is managed; and second, given the inevitably personalized quality of faceto-face negotiating (which the Chinese enhance via the games of guanxi), American negotiators can be better prepared for their encounters with senior PRC officials if they have informed assessments of the personalities and negotiating styles of their counterparts. Mao Zedong comes across in the official record, as well as in the Nixon and Kissinger memoirs,147 as the near-imperial authority he was in China for so many years. His presentational style was highly symbolic, occasionally delphic, and now and then revealing of a peasant crudity that bespoke his social origins.148 He was the most unconstrained of all the PRC leaders in discussing internal as well as international politics; and he would occasionally take personal digs at his colleagues (terming Qiao Guanhua \"Lord Qiao\" and characterizing Guo Moro as \"a man who worships Confucius\"). His presentations set the tone and the political themes for each of the Kissinger and presidential visits during his tenure; his brief but purposeful comments on all topics of concern provided the authority for the presentations of all lower-level officials. And when Zhou Enlai receded from a direct role in the negotiations in late 1973 because of physical illness and political attack, Mao carried the detail of discussions on international events and the Taiwan issue. While it can only be inferred from the negotiating record, it is evident that Mao directed the tactics as well as the grand strategy of the relationship with the United States. It was at his direction that Zhou discussed with Kissinger the meaning of the Cultural Revolution; and Mao the provocateur directed Zhou to attack Kissinger's initial conciliatory approach to drafting the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 in October 1971. The aggressiveness of Mao's personality was evident during the tense year of 1975, when he told Liaison Office Chief George Bush, \"You don't know my temperament. I like people to curse me. feisty mood clearly suffused the entire Chinese political process in his final year of life. Zhou Enlai is revealed in the official negotiating record not only as the cultured conciliator he was known to be worldwide, but also as an official exceptionally deferential to Mao (Nixon, 1978, pp. 223\u2013 236; Nixon, 1980, pp. 217\u2013248; Kissinger, 1979, pp. 742\u2013755). His presentations were laced with references to \"Chairman Mao's wise policy\" or \"Chairman Mao's instructions.\" His prodigious grasp of history gave him considerable debating ammunition, and he would seek to put his interlocutors on the defensive with facts and critiques of the logic of their policies rather than with bluster or pompous argumentation. Zhou could use self-criticism to great effect. And despite his seniority in the Chinese Communist political order, he showed great discipline and reserve in his presentations on all ssues\u2014clearly hewing to Mao's party line. Zhou operated in tandem with Chairman Mao. One of the unresolved mysteries of the last four years of his (and Mao's) life is whether in the final succession crisis Mao withdrew his decades-long support for Zhou to back the Gang of Four, or whether the infirm chairman himself began to lose his grip over the party radicals. 150 Qiao Guanhua is projected in the negotiating record as an intellectual clone of Zhou Enlai, but without Zhou's political stature. His presentational style was, like Zhou's, highly intellectualized; and his barely concealed arrogance is clearly the source of the epithet \"Lord Qiao.\" The feisty Deng Xiaoping, even when still vulnerable after recent political rehabilitation, called Qiao to his face a \"foreign bumpkin\" (yang baozi). When he was expected to apply pressure on an interlocutor, Qiao's presentational style would turn acid and overwhelmingly arrogant\u2014especially in the sessions of October 1975 and his last encounter with Kissinger on October 8, 1976, only a few days before his purge as one who had pandered to the Gang of Four. The six Qiao-Kissinger encounters at the UN in New York City, beginning in the fall of 1972, provide not only a rich elaboration of the key strategic issues underlying the U.S.-PRC relationship, but also a clear sequential record of the political mood of the relationship over a fiveyear period. Huang Hua is revealed in the negotiating record to be Deng Xiaoping's Zhou Enlai\u2014his \"front man.\" Yet the differences between the urbane and cultured Zhou and the acid-tongued Huang are profound. Huang comes across in the 1978\u20131982 period as the political \"heavy,\" the bad guy, in contrast to Deng the conciliator. Huang displayed no political or intellectual flexibility in this period, and his presentations were self-righteously nationalistic, pompous, and unyielding. It was Huang who created the apparent deadlock in the arms-sales talks of 1982 that political rationalizer Deng Xiaoping stepped in to resolve. These brief sketches of the major personalities who confronted U.S. officials across the green baize table in the 1970s and 1980s give only a taste of what can be drawn from the negotiating record in assessing the negotiating styles of individual PRC officials. There is good evidence that the Chinese make detailed assessments of the attitudes and political roles of their negotiating counterparts. The issue for the U.S. government is whether it can better prepare its negotiators for dealings with the Chinese by providing them with more-detailed assessments of the negotiating styles of PRC officials. # COUNTERSTRATEGIES AND COUNTERTACTICS' Intellectual understanding of a political counterpart's approach to managing the negotiating process is of limited practical value unless that understanding can be translated into an effective counterstrategy and countertactics. The issue explored in this chapter is whether or not the analysis of PRC negotiating behavior detailed above provides useful insights into ways of dealing more effectively with the Chinese at the negotiating table\u2014and into the broader range of political relationships that contribute to the negotiating process. While the Chinese have shown considerable skill in controlling the negotiating process and in manipulating their American counterparts in the relationship game, it is possible to conceive of a general orientation for managing the U.S.-PRC relationship and developing tactical negotiating ploys that will enable American officials to maintain sufficient control of the process to attain U.S. policy objectives. This requires, however, not only an understanding of how the Chinese attempt to manage negotiations and an awareness of effective countering techniques, but also a clear definition of U.S. negotiating objectives and sufficient bureaucratic discipline to implement an appropriate counterstrategy. # THE FRUSTRATIONS OF NEGOTIATING WITH THE CHINESE", "metadata": "PRC Negotiating Behavior 1995 RAND.md", "judgement": true}, "44": {"text": "Volume 18 Issue 7 July 2016 Ideological & Political WorkIdeological&PoliticalWork Journal of MilitaryTransportation University Vol.18No.7 July 2016 Analysis on the Psychological Elements of Decision Makers in Our Own Country Zhao Juan Department of Military Psychology, Armed Police Political College, Shanghai 200435) Abstract: In order to promote the development of my country's target strategic coercion and ensure the realization of national security strategy and national interests, this paper analyzes in detail the cognition and belief, emotion and emotion, needs and motivation, personality and style of decision makers in the target country of strategic coercion.

Keywords: strategic deterrence; decision-makers of target countries; psychological factors Since the advent of nuclear weapons, modern coercion has increasingly become the protagonist on the stage of military struggle as a strategy for total victory of \"subjugating the enemy without fighting\". At present, my country is in the great historical process of peaceful rise. To firmly grasp the \"period of important strategic opportunities that can make great achievements\", in addition to needing stronger coordination to resolve international conflicts and crises, we must also have stronger strategic authority to ensure the realization of national interests. Exploring and analyzing the psychological factors of the decision-makers in the target countries of strategic coercion is of great value for promoting the development of my country's target strategic coercion. Received date: 2016-01-23: Revised date: 2016-02-29 About the author: Zhao Juan (1979), female, associate professor The perceptions and Perceptions and beliefs are widely involved in the decision-making process of policymakers in strategically intimidating target countries. In fact, the decision-making process often begins with the attention and perception of a situation of strategic intimidation. In the opinion of political scientists, the perception of the threat of the undermining party by policymakers in the target country is important. If policymakers see another country as a threat, they can 74 It is often assumed that the other party has both strength and intent to hinder the achievement of its goals or endanger its national security. Memory often provides decision-makers with some information related to their decision-making, or decision-makers must use their memory of others and the impressions of others formed on the basis of this memory to explain the policy of the arrogant party. For example, the U.S. designation of certain countries as evil is rooted in those politicians' memories of the early actions of their leaders. Belief systems are more directly linked to decision-makers' decision-making behavior. Ollie Holsty points out that policymakers act on analysis of the situation and perceptions of other countries, which in turn depend on their belief systems. The knowledge of reality is part of the belief system, and the decision-making and behavior of decision-makers depend in part on the knowledge of reality. For example, in one crisis, the intimidating party ostensibly deployed an armoured corps in an attempt to force the target country to accept its demands, and the target country's decision makers assessed the possibility of war and decided whether to back down. However, assuming that the target country's decision makers learn that the tanks are old and do not have sufficient fuel and supplies to actually take military action, the decision makers will correct their beliefs and the final decision may be very different. Cognition and belief can not only guide decision makers to correctly understand the status quo, and rationally determine whether to challenge the intimidating party, but also induce them to develop cognitive biases through habitual and simplified paths, resulting in the failure of intimidation. Taking predisposition as an example, although the vast majority of correct inferences are also strongly influenced by predisposition, it is often paranoid and aspirational, causing decision makers to reject unfavorable evidence and only look at what they expect to see. to the result. For example, in the past 2015, the world was deeply troubled by security. Traditional security issues and non-traditional security issues intertwined. Conflicts and disasters emerged one after another. Then, fighting terrorism is the primary aspiration of many countries. Once there is trouble, the first thing governments consider is a terrorist attack, and quickly make a response plan. People generally see attacks on terrorists, but rarely see other adverse factors, such as people's helplessness and political factors. Another example is the incident of Turkey's downing of a Russian military plane. People must first think of Russia's military retaliation against Turkey, and eagerly expect it to happen, but the result is a series of sanctions and Braille attacks. The sentiment and Moreover, the decision-making of the decision-makers of the standard country under the strategic coercion is often full of Volume 18 Issue 7 Journal of Military Transportation Academy Look at strong negative emotions and emotions, which are related to their methods of challenging their demands and intimidating them. The target country often initiates challenges based on dissatisfaction with the status quo, and the strategic coercion, which is mainly based on threats and force, shows the determination of the intimidating country to completely veto the challenger\u2019s intention to challenge. In this way, hatred, hostility, hatred, fear, despair, and anxiety and tension induced by crisis situations based on obstructed interests and desires run through the decision-making process of the decision-makers in the benchmark country. Fear is the most important emotional issue for decision makers in the target country, and it stems from the perception of one's own vulnerability to attack by other countries, which is almost universal in international politics. Fear, hostility, and military readiness of one adversary prompt the same response in the other, resulting in an escalating spiral of arms races between them, known as the \"fear dilemma.\" Simply put, the fear dilemma is that the actions of one country's policy makers to eliminate fear will inevitably increase the fear of other countries' policy makers. In fact, whether it is the theoretical concept of more than 2,000 years since Thucydides, or historical examples such as the origin of the Peloponnesian War and the US-Soviet Cold War, all show the \"fear dilemma\", the \"psychodynamics of conflict escalation\" \" is a major constant motivation in international relations1]. Howard believes that part of the cause of World War I was the increase in German power and the resulting fear of Britain. In order to ease Tokyo's policy during World War II, the United States and Western European countries first froze Japanese property and then imposed an oil embargo on Japan. The result has sparked fears among Japanese leaders that it will deprive them of the means to continue their rivalry with China and ultimately lead to the loss of any advantage. \"Correspondingly, it created a sense of despair in Tokyo, which was a basic prerequisite for the subsequent attack on Pearl Harbor.\" The terror threat in 2015, which engulfed most of the population in a sense of fear, led to a large influx of refugees. people Europe. According to the European Commission forecast, by the end of 2016, the total number of refugees entering Europe will reach 3 million. This has laid a legal foundation for countries to send troops into Syria to fight terrorist organizations. To this end, French President Francois Hollande stressed that the fight against terrorism \"is not over yet\"; European countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy and other European countries have declared war on terrorism; Nigeria and Cameroon have pledged to \"do whatever it takes\" to combat \"Boko Haram extremist groups, etc.\" It is also fear, but the fear caused by the ultimate weapon can greatly inhibit the desire of decision-makers to challenge. Khrushchev once said that (in a nuclear war) the living will be jealous of the dead. Because no one can predict that once a nuclear war starts, The destruction effect caused by the world, so the Soviet and American policymakers had to restrain their own behavior while being vigilant about the opponent's direction. Kenneth Waltz pointed out that during the Cold War, the \"fear of the whole beast sacrifice\" between the United States and the Soviet Union for the nuclear war was in the previous countries. July 2016 never appeared in the relationship. Today's threat of nuclear war has changed, but panic still plays a restraining role. The threat and counter-threat situation caused by strategic coercion can easily induce the nervousness of the decision makers of the target country. Under great pressure and high tension, decision makers' cognition may be completely different from usual, and even policy and behavior patterns may change, such as increased random behaviors, increased error rate, moving toward simpler and primitive response patterns, and adopting forceful responses. Problem solving, distraction, and reduced tolerance for ambiguity, among others. Holsty confirms that threatening tactics can significantly \"increase the tension that forces the other side to take action,\" which in turn increases the urgency of time and the danger of policymakers relying on those single, familiar options , regardless of whether these solutions are effective solutions to current problems. Research on World War I, the Korean War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis demonstrates that as tensions rise during crises, interactions between target country policymakers and intimidating parties diminish and become more stylized. At present, both the United States and Russia are developing and deploying strategic missile hypersonic glide warheads, which can theoretically break through any existing air defense system. In terms of developing new conventional means of strategic coercion, the United States, Russia and other countries are competing to develop conventional strategic containment capabilities centered on large-scale \"global rapid strike\" capabilities. On the basis of the establishment of the Global Strike Command in 2009, the U.S. military formulated a vision of \"global rapid strike\" before 2030, and developed a hypersonic cruise aircraft based on the SR-51A, which will integrate technology with aerospace aircraft to form an aerospace integration. The hypersonic aviation-spaceflight general-purpose platform will be used as our platform to upgrade the \"global rapid strike\" system to the \"global instant strike\" system, which poses a huge challenge to the existing nuclear weapons-based strategic containment system, which also forms tension between the two sides. pressure chain. The needs and The needs and motivations of policy makers in target countries have been widely recognized as important variables that lead to the failure of coercion. John Vasquez concluded that, at the individual level, conflicts erupted from the strong security needs and frustration motives of decision makers. Dignity-related \"face\" is an important class of needs and behavioral motives that compel decision-makers to take action. U.S. President Kennedy found that policymakers are often forced to respond to the actions of the other party for \u201cface\u201d reasons, which in turn will lead to a response from the other party, which ultimately leads to an escalation of armed conflict. .1] Karen Horney believes that those \"fanatical pursuit of honor\" decisions Juan: Analysis of the Psychological Elements of Decision Makers in Strategically Powerful Target Countries 175 Those who choose to do it in the form of external challenges. According to another study on the desire for power, the greater the desire for power displayed by the decision makers, the more aggressive the government will be [2]. The needs and motivations described above all seriously affect the stability of strategic authority. Often, overpowering needs and motives can easily induce a motive bias that can lead to a failure of coercion. Motivational biases are mostly produced in three ways. First, policymakers in target countries feel the need to address pressing domestic threats, including resolving internal conflicts, securing the ruling position of policymakers and their parties, and even protecting sectoral interests. Due to the difficult situation in the country, on the one hand, policy makers begin to believe that these threats can only be solved by challenging the intimidating party and changing the status quo.

Peter Martin, \"The Humbling of the NDRC: China's National Development and Reform Commission Searches for a New Role Amid Restructuring,\" China Brief, March 6, 2014. \u2021 When Xi came to power in 2012, the National Development and Reform Commission was also \"one of the first major bureaucracies to fall under Xi's anticorruption radar. Dozens of [National Development and Reform Commission] officials were netted, including Deputy Director Liu Tienan, who managed the energy portfolio.\" Neil Thomas, \"Change of Plans: Making Market Capitalism Safe for China,\" MacroPolo, December 30, 2018.\n---\n50 ## Increasing Supervision and Control of Local Experimentation beyond the 20th Party Congress Despite Xi's centralization drive, economic policy implementation of top-level directives retains decentralized features. The reasons for this are structural, pragmatic, and strategic. Structurally, given China's geographic and population size, central leaders have little choice but to rely on local-level implementation of their plans. Pragmatically, central leaders continue to derive utility from local governments and officials figuring out what high-level directives such as \"supply-side structural reform\" should mean in practice. By passing responsibility to local levels, the central government puts the onus of resource expenditure on them while preserving its own resources. Further, the center can actively promote the specific implementation solutions that work well at the local level. Strategically, the central government is able to shift blame onto local governments whenever anything goes wrong. As Ran Ran and Yan Jian, scholars of Chinese politics, explain, \"Upper level Chinese officials are inclined to deflect the blame downward to those at the lower levels who are in a less powerful position in the administrative system.\"\u00b9\u2076\u2070 All of these factors enable Xi to take credit when things go right, blame others when things go wrong, and allow those below him to do the difficult work of trying to implement vague and contradictory top-level guidance. Dr. Teets emphasized in testimony before the Commission, however, that policy experimentation in the Xi era is increasingly \"supervised,\" with digital governance tools augmenting the center's ability to \"directly monitor local compliance.\"\u00b9\u2076\u00b9 This has led the governance structure to become \"less fragmented between Party and State, and between the central and local levels of government, removing much of the previous policy discretion in the system.\"\u00b9\u2076\u00b2 While reduced local discretion has benefits related to better implementation, less corruption, and more mobilization and standardization capacity, Xi's changes to governance have also led to confusion and frustration among cadres who face less clarity on promotion prospects, a sense of paralysis, and decreasing morale.\u00b9\u2076\u00b3 Centralization and bureaucratization remain ongoing processes and are far from complete, but the shift to this style of governance will increasingly endure \"the same problems that all rigid bureaucracies do: less innovation to solve local problems, inadequacy of \"one-size-fits-all policies,\" challenges of collecting enough information, and of regulating elite ambition within the system.\"\u00b9\u2076\u2074 Nonetheless, Dr. Teets assesses that through the 20th Party Congress and beyond, \"Xi Jinping's belief that the Party-state system was facing existential threats under the previous system makes any deviation from political centralization unlikely.\"*\u00b9\u2076\u2075 *Optimistically, Dr. Teets forecasts that as \"power accrues to the Party leadership and former veto players are pushed out of the system, we will observe policy reform in traditionally challenging areas, such as the urbanization-household registration nexus, advanced economic reform, and land reform. In the past, these reforms were not feasible because local or factional leaders opposed them, but now these changes may be made.\" Jessica Teets, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on CCP Decision-Making and the 20th Party Congress, January 27, 2022, 4.\n---\n51 # Placing, Promoting, and Rewarding Personnel in the Economic Domain: Xi's Network of Loyalists Building and placing networks of loyalists in key domains is one of the most important aspects of control in the CCP's Leninist system. In the sprawling economic domain in particular, wherein numerous technical issue areas make it impossible for one individual to track everything at the center let alone at the localities, Xi relies on a coterie of loyalists to carry out his will. Xi leans heavily on the CCP's Central Organization Department, a powerful Party organ that directly monitors, evaluates, and controls promotions for thousands of positions throughout the Party system, thus making it an immensely important institution to Xi's plans for economic grand steerage as well for the millions of cadres seeking promotion into positions of prominence.* The Organization Department's influence has only increased since 2018, when the State Administration of Civil Service, which formerly handled the appointment and assignment of state officials, was abolished and its functions absorbed into the Organization Department.\u00b9\u2076\u2076 Xi has filled the Organization Department's leadership role, effectively his \"chief personnel officer,\" with close associate Chen Xi, who was his roommate and close friend as a fellow \"worker-peasant-soldier student\" at Tsinghua University, when they both studied the same subject (chemical engineering) at the same time (1975\u20131979).\u00b9\u2076\u2077 Control over the Organization Department allows Xi not only to promote loyalists to any position within the \"leading cadre system,\" including the heads of the provincial organization departments, but also to embed his preferred economic promotion metrics into the evaluation criteria leading cadres compete to meet, mobilizing China's personnel apparatus to further his own politically informed economic development agenda.\u00b9\u2076\u2078 Xi's loyalists are also perched atop the key \"comprehensive\" economic decision units, namely those that are more important than specific functional bureaucracies. Most important in this regard is Liu He, who handles the relevant economic issues at both the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission. Liu, as with Chen Xi, is a close associate from Xi's youth.\u00b9\u2076\u2079 In the state bureaucracy, Xi also placed He Lifeng, one of his closest associates dating back to their time in Fujian in the 1980s, at the head of the National Development and Reform Commission.\u00b9\u2077\u2070 He could become Xi's top economic advisor, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal, taking over for Liu and overseeing day-to-day economic work at the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reform Commission and the Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission.\u00b9\u2077\u00b9 Liu is over the implicit retirement age and, if the implicit norm holds, would vacate these positions at the 20th Party Congress.\u00b9\u2077\u00b2 *The leading cadre system is estimated to contain over two million positions, with roughly 2,500 at the provincial/ministerial level. Cadre evaluation has also become substantially more centralized over time, with the Organization Department promulgating a variety of more specific metrics, the provinces more closely monitoring the counties, and the center more closely monitoring the provinces for compliance.

Christopher Carothers, postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for the Study of Contemporary China and an expert on Xi's anticorruption campaign, has documented the rise of inspections and their transition from \"corruption control to everything control.\" 173 Dr. Carothers argues that the \"Xi administration initially strengthened inspections to combat corruption but then repurposed them to serve as a top-down governance mechanism in numerous other areas as well,\" including implementation of Xi's economic development initiatives. 174 Investigations and inspections have become tools to coerce a geographically and functionally fragmented and decentralized bureaucracy and group of local elites into compliance with top-down economic decisions. 175 Dr. Carothers notes that these visits \"produce a great deal of fear among bureaucrats and businesspeople,\" as inspectors' determinations, which are increasingly focused on substantively monitoring policy implementation, can have \"swift and dramatic consequences.\" 176 As in other domains, Xi relies in particular on the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and the National Supervisory Commission\u2014both of which are headed by Xi loyalists\u2014to enforce implementation of central economic decisions.* 177 Xi's much-touted campaign to eliminate absolute poverty\u2020 in China is a prominent example of the involvement of these commissions in disciplining lower-level decision-makers and implementers. The National Supervisory Commission and CCDI worked at Xi's personal instruction to pressure and closely monitor Party and government officials to enact his campaign-style poverty reduction efforts, investigating and disciplining more than 99,000 people in 2019 for corruption related to poverty alleviation efforts. 178 More recently, investigations have been ongoing into leaders in areas related to China's flagging technological upgrading ambitions. Xiao Yaqing, responsible for overseeing industrial policy initiatives in semiconductors and other high-technology areas as the Minister of Industry and Information Technology, was removed from his post as minister in July 2022 and placed under investigation for a \"violation of discipline and law,\" making him the highest-ranking official ensnared ---- *The head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Zhao Leji, is considered one of Xi's two closest allies on the Politburo Standing Committee. The head of the National Supervisory Commission, Yang Xiaodu, served with Xi in Shanghai and was a deputy of Wang Qishan for several years prior to his appointment in March 2018.

In addition, to further verify the robustness of the baseline regression and mechanism test results, this study replaced the count variable of the total number of specific emotional words with a continuous variable of the emotional value and included it in the analysis of variance and analysis of covariance. ## **The results show that the robustness test further supports the theoretical hypothesis proposed in this study. On the one hand, the AI \u200b\u200bbig language model has the ability to \"turn black into white\" to stimulate emotions. It shapes cognition and thinking patterns by selectively presenting information and falsifying facts, and guides users to have positive emotions about the legitimacy of US foreign policy and behavior, thus possessing the potential for AI cognitive warfare. On the other hand, the AI \u200b\u200bbig language model can mobilize emotions, mobilize positive emotions and influence cognition and thinking patterns by amplifying legitimacy, beautifying its own image, and discrediting the other party's image, thus possessing the potential for algorithmic cognitive warfare.** # **Revelation: Artificial Intelligence Cognitive Warfare and National Security** # **risk** The core operational concept of AI cognitive warfare is to overwhelm and manipulate the opponent's thinking and control the opponent's cognition, ultimately weakening the enemy's overall combat effectiveness. \"Intelligence advantage\" or \"cognitive control\" will become a new area for hostile parties to compete for control in the era of intelligent warfare. AI cognitive warfare has become a struggle for cognition, people's hearts and minds. The combination of AI and cognitive warfare has completely changed the way cognitive warfare operates. Compared with traditional physical warfare or cognitive warfare, AI cognitive warfare is more powerful and covert, able to quietly dismantle the enemy's decision-making system and seize the advantage at the psychological level of the conflict. As a product of this era, large language models are rapidly becoming a key force in AI cognitive warfare with their excellent data processing and language generation capabilities. This study found that the AI \u200b\u200bbig language model has the ability to \"turn black into white\" and stimulate emotions. It shapes cognition and thinking patterns by selectively presenting information and falsifying facts, guiding users to have positive emotions about the legitimacy of US foreign policy and behavior. The big language model raises the basic emotional tone of the narrative of US foreign policy and behavior events, achieving the effect of \"emotional communication\", thereby manipulating users' emotional impressions, subtly changing users' cognition of US foreign policy and actions, and highlighting the legitimacy of US policies and actions. In addition, ChatGPT selectively presents and emphasizes the legitimacy of the US's actions, constructs a cognitive environment for users from a perspective that is biased towards the US's position, and describes the opponent as \"evil\" and \"threatening\", and describes the US as \"just and impartial\", etc., creating powerful positive and negative polarized emotional narratives for users, quickly stimulating their emotional responses and thereby impacting their existing cognitive structures and thinking patterns. ## **Cognitive manipulation and the spread of false information pose a serious threat to cognitive security. Cognitive security risks involve struggles in the cultural and ideological fields. From the perspective of national security risk prevention, cognitive domain security means that the ideology, values, and ways of thinking of groups and individuals within the country are not manipulated and transformed by internal and external forces. The object-oriented characteristics of cognitive domain security are becoming more and more obvious. Traditional large-scale and general defense measures are no longer sufficient to deal with precise cognitive attacks, and more detailed and personalized defense strategies must be developed. Intelligence-driven becomes cognitive domain security.** The development of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology has greatly improved the intelligence level of information warfare and psychological warfare. Intelligent algorithms can not only automatically collect and analyze information, but also autonomously generate highly influential content and adjust and optimize it based on real-time feedback. This intelligent attack method has put forward higher requirements for national security. We must stay ahead in technology, based on \"cognitive domain security\" and counter \"cognitive weaponization\", and establish a complete intelligent defense system. \\[Submission date: 2024-05-16\\] \\[Revision date: 2024-07-13\\] \\[Editor: Li Shuisheng\\]", "metadata": "CHN_Cognitive_Weaponization_Cognitive_Warfare_Artificial_Intelligence_University_International_Relations_Sep2024-2_llama-parse_en.md", "judgement": true}, "48": {"text": "\ufeffAugust\t2023\nStrategic Culture \u2013 Its History, Issues, and Complexity Dr. Allison Astorino-Courtois Principal Investigator \nDr. Lawrence Kuznar Author \nNathan Heath Co-author\nGeorge Popp Co-author Preferred citation:\nKuznar, L., Heath, N., & Popp, G.

This report examines the concept\u2019s history, current consensus, and enduring debates about what it entails. It also proposes a model of strategic culture as a complex system. What is strategic culture? After a review of relevant literature, we propose the following definition: An actor\u2019s1 strategic culture is composed of beliefs, experiences, assumptions, attitudes, and patterned behaviors that shape perceptions and preferences about its security-related interests, objectives, and activities. This definition reflects the consensus of most scholars. However, key issues remain concerning the relationship of strategic behavior to strategic culture, the social and political levels at which it operates, and how strategic culture can be modeled. Strategic behavior and strategic culture. Many scholars assert a recursive relationship between strategic culture and strategic behavior. Culture can impact behaviors, and behaviors sometimes reinforce elements of culture. However, if the concept of strategic culture is to be useful for national security analysis, it must predict some amount of an organization\u2019s strategic behavior. Including all strategic behaviors (e.g., nuclear postures, military investments, deployments, military conduct in war, operations under the level of armed conflict) in the definition of strategic culture potentially creates a tautology that undermines prediction. To avoid this tautology, only traditional, repeated, and patterned behaviors are included in our definition of strategic culture, allowing other elements of strategic behavior to emerge independently. Whether or not strategic culture influences strategic behavior remains an open question. Furthermore, there is consensus among scholars that factors, such as pragmatic material concerns, influence strategic behaviors and may override the effect of strategic culture all together. The influence of strategic culture on strategic behavior should be considered an empirical question to be tested in specific applications. Whose strategic culture matters? Strategic cultures exist at the international, national, and subnational levels, like political parties, popular opinion, intelligentsia, and powerful stakeholders. Any analysis of an actor\u2019s strategic behavior must identify which stakeholders and their associated strategic cultures actually influence it. Strategic culture as a complex system. Scholars have proposed that strategic culture is composed of identity, values, perceptions, and patterned behaviors. However, these elements are not independent; they can influence each other, creating a complex system of interrelationships. The complex system model we propose allows for the adaptation of the strategic culture concept to different nations and contexts. Background The 21st century operational environment challenges Western 20th century strategic concepts. The 21st century began with a US focus on asymmetric threats from non-state actors who held incompatibly different views, values, and motivations from the West. Meanwhile, adversarial states retooled their strategic approaches to compete with, and potentially undermine, Western power and the rules-based order by competing below the level of open armed conflict. The need to understand the motives, interests, and potential actions of these culturally different state and non-state actors led to renewed interest in the role that an actor\u2019s culture plays in its strategic behavior, and by extension, efforts to deter it. The concept that an actor\u2019s strategic culture2 influences its strategic behavior is both intuitive and ancient. It implies that different actors approach competition and conflict with different cultural lenses, assumptions, and perhaps behaviors.3 An early nod to strategic culture was proposed by the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu 2,500 years ago in his directive that \u201cone who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be endangered in a hundred engagements\u201d (Sun Tzu, 1963, p. 84). The ancient Greek historian Thucydides attributed the Athenians\u2019 power to their cultural and psychological attributes of innovation and restlessness (Thucydides, 1954, pp. 75-76). In The Conquest of Gaul, written around 50 BCE, Julius Caesar provided descriptions of Germanic culture and how he thought it inclined them for war. Centuries later, Clausewitz (1943, p. 125) stressed moral qualities, an element of culture, as a key dimension of war. An overview of strategic culture-like concepts in historical perspective is presented in... Prior to World War II, anthropologists of the culture and personality school of thought proposed that the way a people are socialized in a particular culture leads to the development of modal personality types that, in turn, give each culture a distinct character (Benedict, 1959). The leaders of this school of thought, Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict, used this approach during WWII in national character studies intended to provide insight into US, Japanese, and Soviet ways of war (Al-Rodhan, 2015; Benedict, 1946; Hinton, 2020; Mead, 1942). Thinking about the relationship of culture to strategy continued to be influenced by anthropologists after WWII. Nathan Leites (1951) credited Margaret Mead with influencing his notion of an operational code.4 The next major work on culture and strategy was Jack Snyder\u2019s landmark 1977 study of Soviet strategic decision-making in which he coined the term strategic culture. He defined it as: The sum total of ideas, conditioned emotional responses, and patterns of habitual behavior that members of a national strategic community have acquired through instruction or imitation and share with each other with regard to [nuclear] strategy (Snyder, 1977, p. 8). Snyder\u2019s work motivated academic scrutiny of the concept, resulting in several \u201cgenerations\u201d or schools of thought regarding what strategic culture is, whose strategic culture matters, and, most important, what (if any) effect strategic culture has on an actor\u2019s strategic behavior.5 This report will address these fundamental questions and propose a model of strategic culture along with illustrations of Russian and Chinese strategic culture. Strategic Culture\u2014The Debates Important epistemological, theoretical, and empirical issues about the definition and usefulness of \u201cstrategic culture\u201d remain unresolved. Nevertheless, assertions about the importance of the concept have persisted. In 2005, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) funded a workshop that involved about two dozen strategic culture researchers in an effort to resolve debates in the field, develop a methodology for systematic application of strategic culture to national security issues, apply that methodology, and provide a curriculum for teaching comparative strategic culture (Larsen, 2006). The DTRA workshop participants came to agreement on a number of crucial issues (Johnson, 2006). They agreed that strategic culture changes, although more slowly than other political influences, and therefore has the potential for long-term influences on strategic behaviors that typically occur on shorter timescales. Furthermore, all agreed that a state\u2019s strategic culture is only one among many factors that influence its strategic behavior. Pragmatic concerns, such as military might and alliances, also influence strategic behavior and may very well supersede any influence strategic culture may have on specific actions. The participants also agreed that in any nation, multiple sub-national groups and organizations are stakeholders who can have differing strategic cultures and that any complete analysis of a nation\u2019s strategic behavior must consider what these are, their interactions, and their influences on strategic behavior. As to whether strategic culture causes behavior, the contributors differed. Some, such as Colin Gray (1999, 2006), maintained that the concept is primarily useful for providing a context for understanding behavior. Others, such as Christopher Twomey (2006), remained skeptical that strategic culture could explain behavior. However, all contributors agreed that strategic cultures exist, can be systematically identified, and are important when contemplating strategic behavior.\nThe DTRA study produced a conceptual model of strategic culture based on four key variables: national identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens. Furthermore, the study authors proposed that these variables can be measured by dozens of inputs, such as sacred texts, historical political systems, interactions with other nations, demographics, and global norms. Their model is elaborated further below (see Strategic Culture as a Complex System: A Model). They applied their model to analyze US, Russian, Chinese, Israeli, Indian, Pakistani, Iranian, Syrian, and al Qaeda strategic cultures in an effort to demonstrate its usefulness (Larsen, 2006). Interest in strategic culture has continued (Adamsky, 2020; Antczak, 2018; Gotz & Staun, 2022; Hassner, 2014, 2016; Herd, 2022; Hinton, 2020; Johnson, 2021; Libel, 2020; Pillsbury, 2015; Rumer & Sokolsky, 2020; Scobell, 2014; Simalcik, 2020; Sinovets, 2016; Tellis, 2016; Zarobny & Salek-Iminska, 2021). Bloomfield (2012, p. 456) attempted to unite competing views of strategic culture and concluded that \u201cfrom Gray we take the notion that culture provides context; that it guides and shapes interpretation: we just have to accept that culture is a disaggregated thing with contradictory elements rather than a monolithic whole. From Johnston, we take the goal of building falsifiable theory.\u201d However, not all scholars find value in the concept; Echevarria (2013) concluded that strategic culture is a concept with \u201cmore problems than prospects\u201d that should be abandoned. Strategic Culture in US Deterrence Concepts Finally, it should be noted that the concept of strategic culture is both implicit and featured in important US national security documents. The concept of tailored deterrence introduced in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) directed that US deterrence strategies and operations should be tailored to different types of adversaries, such as nuclear states, non-nuclear state adversaries, and non-state terrorist organizations, and should include the different kinds of forces and military capabilities emergent in the 21st century (U.S. Department of Defense, 2006). The 2006 QDR also stressed the need for understanding the cultures of adversaries and populations among whom warfighters operated. Elaine Bunn (2007, p. 3) pointed out that by invoking the need to tailor deterrence to other types of actors, tailored deterrence implied a need for understanding the strategic cultures of adversaries, and to be feasible, it must address questions, such as, \u201cWhat are the nation\u2019s or group\u2019s values and priorities? How are these affected by its history and strategic culture?\u201d She also emphasized the need for communications to adversaries to be tailored to adversaries\u2019 perceptions, which are shaped by \u201can adversary\u2019s national and cultural attributes as well as its unique history of dealing with and studying the United States (Bunn, 2007, p. 7).\u201d6 The 2022 National Security Strategy (NSS) introduced the concept of integrated deterrence (White House, 2022, p. 22). The 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) considers integrated deterrence to be its \u201ccenterpiece,\u201d while noting that it should be \u201ctailored to specific competitors and challenges\u201d (U.S. Department of Defense, 2022, p. iv). The inclusion of tailored deterrence and its implicit mandate to consider culture logically connects strategic culture to the new integrated deterrence concept. Strategic Culture\u2014What Is It? What are the main components of \u201cstrategic culture\u201d? We reviewed 22 published definitions and identified specific elements encompassing ideological, affective (i.e., emotional), cognitive, experiential, and behavioral factors. We propose the following based on our review of the 22 definitions in Table 1:", "metadata": "2023-08-29_Kuznar-Strategic-Culture_final3_2-cl.txt", "judgement": true}, "49": {"text": "\ufeffChinese Strategic Culture: Traditional and Present Features Tiejun Zhang Published online: 11 Nov 2010 Tiejun Zhang (2002) Chinese Strategic Culture: Traditional and Present Features, Comparative Strategy, 21:2, 73-90, DOI: 10.1080/0149593029004305 TIEJUN ZHANG Zhejiang University Hangzhou, People\u2019s Republic of China This paper examines the major factors shaping and primary features of both the traditional and current Chinese strategic cultures. By rejecting the term of \u201cCultural Realism\u201d covering both versions of the strategic cultures, traditional Chinese strategic culture centered on \u201cCultural Moralism\u201d is conceived as mainly influenced by Confucian preference of non\u2013violent means to external aggression. The present version of Chinese strategic culture expressed in the form of \u201cDefensive Realism,\u201d on the other hand, though has certain linkages with its traditional counterpart, stresses more on the material strength than cultural and ideational preferences. As China increasingly gains prominence in world affairs, its security strategy has been attracting more and more attention from the outside world, academia and foreign policy practitioners alike. Traditional Chinese strategic culture, as many scholars assert, has to a large extent influenced the contemporary Chinese\u2013making of security strategy. Alastair Iain Johnston argues that \u201cChina has historically exhibited a relatively consistent hard realpolitik or parabellum strategic culture that persisted across different structural contexts into the Maoists period (and beyond).\u201d While claiming that \u201cthe threat and use of force is central to China\u2019s history,\u201d Shu Guang Zhang sees that \u201cPRC\u2013dominated strategic culture is deeply rooted in the nation\u2019s history of warfare.\u201d Both Johnston and Zhang in fact downplay (even deny) the Confucian impact on traditional Chinese strategic culture, while at the same time exaggerate the influences of the traditional strategic culture on its present counterpart. In contrary to Johnston and Zhang\u2019s views, the author believes that traditional Chinese strategic culture is primarily characterized by \u201ccultural moralism.\u201d The term \u201ccultural moralism\u201d here is understood as a prolonged habit or practice of moralizing and a persistent emphasis on morality, exemplified by Confucian belief on virtue (de), benevolence (ren) and righteousness (yi) as basic norms in maintaining domestic order and conducting security strategy. Due to fundamental changes in international and domestic circumstances, the contemporary version of Chinese strategic culture, though retaining certain elements of its traditional counterpart, is a significant deviation from it, and featured mainly on \u201cdefensive realism\u201d that stresses more on the material strength than cultural and ideational preferences. The discussion that follows will, in line with an approach of cultural moralism, firstly analyze how Confucianism, together with other related factors, shaped the traditional Chinese strategic culture. This will be followed by an analysis on the major features of that culture. In contemporary time, though there have been fundamental changes both domestically and internationally. Traditional Chinese strategic culture is still, to a certain extent, relevant to its present version, though the Chinese state is now much more sensitive to the signals of regional and international changes than in the imperial era when there were hierarchical relations between the Chinese heartland and the periphery. Traditional Chinese Strategic Culture Factors Shaping Traditional Chinese Strategic Culture For roughly two millenniums (from 221 B. C. when Qin Shihuang created the first unified Chinese state to the 1840s when the Opium War broke out), the central goal of China\u2019s security strategy had been defending the economic, political, social and cultural heartland of China. Geopolitically, the Chinese heartland encompasses primarily the present Northern, Eastern, Southern and Central China, centered on the Yellow River Basin in the North and the Changjiang River Basin in Central and Eastern China. To the South, Southwest and the West, the boundaries of the heartland were mainly those of mountains, jungles and plateaus. The North and Northwestern boundaries of it were defined primarily by vast arid steppes and deserts. Comparatively speaking, in most occasions throughout the imperial China, the expansion of the heartland had normally confronted much more severe resistance from the nomads of the North and Northwest than from other directions. In fact, a constant and at times serious threat to the heartland had been from the nomads there. In the imperial history, to defend the heartland, the Chinese state was obliged to directly or indirectly control, influence, or neutralize a vast periphery around it. This periphery consists mainly of the present Inner and Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet and Northeast China, as well as Northern Korea and the Northern part of the present continental Southeast Asia. Generally speaking, therefore, the periphery of the imperial China extends primarily to the continental borders surrounding the heartland, and to a much less extent, to the maritime boundaries. Therefore, imperial China was mainly a continental power with few maritime interests. Throughout the imperial era, this continental power was not compelled to control or influence beyond its immediate periphery, since no other major powers were situated to threaten China. Geoeconomically speaking, the Chinese heartland was virtually a self-sufficient economic sphere in the two millenniums. Though China maintained trade with the outside both on land routes such as the \u201csilk road\u201d and sea routes, external commerce had rarely played a significant role in Chinese history. In accordance with the geopolitical factor, the continental trade routes were comparatively more important than the sea routes. The only cases that exceptionally highlighted the importance of the sea trade routes were ones of the Southern Song (1127\u20131279) and Ming (1368\u20131644) Dynasties. In the Southern Song Dynasty, owing to the loss of Northern China to Nomadic states such as the Liao, Jin and Xixia, the Chinese state was forced to defend effectively the growingly important maritime trade and transportation routes along the eastern and southern coastlines, in addition to the further development of agriculture and commerce of the continental Southern China. For this purpose, the Southern Song Dynasty maintained a relatively strong navy. In the early Ming Dynasty, for promoting maritime trade and tackling domestic politics, seven maritime voyages headed by Zheng He were undertaken by order of Emperor Yongle in the early 15th century. The Zheng He voyages which normally contained several dozens of ships with thousands of soldiers seldom, with the exception of Ceylon, used force against local people where they passed through, including present\u2013day Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Arabic Peninsula, and East Africa. In contrast to European colonists several decades later, the early Ming Dynasty had no intention of colonializing. The economic self\u2013sufficiency of the traditional China gave rise to \u201ca national cultural psychology of preference on permanent settlement to migration, as well as persistent search for and maintenance of social stability.\u201d As for the demographic factor, the majority (more than 90%) of the heartland dwellers were ethnic Han Chinese who had maintained a homogeneous culture centered on, among other things, a single written language and Confucian ideology. This single written language has been very significant in contributing to the coherence of the heartland. Though there have been hundreds of dialects in China and people from different parts of China can hardly understand each other when they use their own dialects to communicate, a single written language has served as a culturally coherent bond which links people from various areas of the country. The Confucian ideology (especially since the Western Han Dynasty), on the other hand, had not only served as a culturally coherent bond, but the centerpiece of the cultural superiority of the Chinese heartland in its contacts with the periphery \u201cbarbarians.\u201d This cultural superiority was also one of the most important bases for China to establish and maintain the hierarchical relations between the heartland and the periphery. Confucian Domination on the Strategic Culture Since the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC\u201324 AD), Confucianism had been the dominant political ideology until the end of the imperial era in the mid\u201319th century. This dominant position was further strengthened in the Sui Dynasty (581\u2013618) when Confucian philosophy became the main content for the imperial examination in selecting officials, and again consolidated in the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279) when the totalitarian power of the emperors was even more stressed and the male\u2013dominated social order that emphasized the absolute obedience of females towards males was extremely highlighted. The emperors themselves and officials (both military and civilian ones) were also educated with Confucianism (as the primary subject and in some cases the only one). In this political context, it is not persuasive to assert, as some would argue, that traditional Chinese strategy\u2013makers (including both civilian and military officials as well as the emperors themselves) who were educated with Confucianism would substantially take anti\u2013Confucian attitudes in making security strategies, and certainly untenable to argue against the significant Confucian impacts on traditional Chinese strategic culture. In close examination, the author\u2019s view is that Confucianism indeed played a dominant role in the strategic culture of imperial China that can be defined by the term cultural moralism. Cultural moralism here refers to the habit and practice of constant moralizing and a persistent emphasis on morality, characterized by Confucian norms of Virtue, Benevolence and Righteousness for judging the domestic and foreign policies of rulers. In Confucian belief, the ruler\u2019s exemplary and benevolent conduct originated from his personal virtue (de) drew the people to him and rendered him the mandate to rule. This norm, as asserted, was applicable to both people in the Chinese heartland and the \u201cbarbarians\u201d in the periphery. Confucians, in general, opposed the offensive or excessive use of force against external enemies for the reason that the very application of this force undermines the authority and legitimacy of the whole imperial order. In their view, the maintenance of this order depends on the observance of Confucian benevolence and virtue, not compulsion through the offensive or excessive use of force, though there could be exceptions as analyzed in the following paragraphs. Benevolence (ren) is defined by Confucius as \u201ccaring for people.\u201d Virtue (de), benevolence (ren) and righteousness (yi) are the central norms in Confucianism. For clarifying his view on benevolence, Confucius himself asserts that \u201cpeace and harmony among people are the most precious,\u201d and \u201cdo not unto others what you do not like others unto you.\u201d Though argued by some that the traditional Chinese strategic thoughts are, to a large extent, contrary or at least irrelevant to Confucianism, one can easily discern repeated emphases on \u201cren\u201d and \u201cyi\u201d in a variety of major works of traditional Chinese strategic thinking. In Sun Zi\u2019s Art of War, ren is one of the five criteria for being a general though he gave it the specific meaning of caring for soldiers. In Wu Zi\u2019s Art of War, Sun Bin Bin Fa, Wei Liao Zi and Shi Ma Fa, the two terms (\u201cren\u201d and \u201cyi\u201d) are also highly valued. By extension, the term \u201cyi zhan\u201d refers to the righteous or justified war. In Guan Zi, it is asserted that \u201cwith only braveness and no justice, the army would be frustrated; and the failure of war results from the injustice of it.\u201d In Shi Ma Fa, war is justified by the famous saying that \u201cit is righteous to wage wars if the purpose of it is to stop wars,\u201d and the sole justification for launching a sanctioned attack would be the eradication of governmental evil. It should be noted that not only virtue, benevolence and righteousness are essential in Confucianism, the term of righteous war itself is also highly advocated by Confucians. For instance, Mencius maintained that punitive military expeditions to chastise evil rulers and relieve people from suffering should be justified. And also, Mencius juxtaposes \u201cba dao\u201d (the way of illegitimate hegemon) against \u201cwang dao\u201d (the way of the legitimate kings) in a duality of legitimate versus illegitimate rule, that is, \u201ca ba (hegemon) who resorted to force and coercion against his people was thought to lack the Mandate and Legitimacy.
