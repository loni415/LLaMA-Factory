The study was in the tradition of earlier RAND research\u2014especially Fred C. Ikl\u00e9's pathbreaking work of $1 9 6 4 ^ { 1 }$ \u2014and was designed to assess the way Chinese negotiators sought to manage the process of constructing a normal relationship with the United States. Such a study, it was assumed, would also provide a useful contrast with the \"adversarial negotiations\" that had characterized dealings between the two governments in the period between the Korean War years and the unproductive negotiations of the 1950s and 1960s at Geneva and Warsaw. The principal investigator of the study, Richard H. Solomon, served as a staff member of the National Security Council during the initial years of normalization talks between the United States and the PRC and was already familiar with much of the negotiating record. Because the study drew on official negotiating documentation, the initial publication of the work was classified Secret, although an unclassified briefing summary was published by RAND in 1985.2 In 1994, a federal court action led to declassification of most of the 1985 study, based on a Freedom of Information Act suit that had been filed against the government by the Los Angeles Times. RAND is publishing the declassified parts of the study at this time because of the analytical and historical value of the work, and because of the continuing interest to the United States of managing effectively a relationship with a major country that is likely to be of even greater significance in world affairs in the coming century. The reader should be aware that about 10 percent of the original study was not declassified.

It is designed to provide guidance for senior American officials prior to their first negotiating encounters with PRC counterparts and to establish control over the documentary record of U.S.- PRC political exchanges between 1967 and 1984. This assessment is based on analysis of the official negotiating record of U.S.-PRC exchanges during this period (the memoranda of conversation\u2014\"memcons\"\u2014and reporting cables that document formal exchanges), interviews with more than thirty U.S. officials who have conducted political negotiations with the Chinese, and such additional materials as the memoirs of former senior U.S. government officials, Chinese press statements, and official PRC documentation. The basic finding of this study is that Chinese officials conduct negotiations in a distinctive, but not unique, manner consisting of a highly organized and meticulously managed progression of welldefined stages. It is an approach influenced by both Western diplomatic practice and the Marxist-Leninist tradition acquired from the Soviet Union and through dealings with the international communist movement. Its fundamental style and most distinctive qualities, however, are based on China's own cultural tradition and political practices. The most distinctive characteristic of Chinese negotiating behavior is the effort to develop and manipulate strong interpersonal relationships with foreign officials\u2014a pattern termed here \"the games of guanxi,\" or relationship games. This approach to politics is shaped by China's Confucian political tradition. The Chinese distrust impersonal or legalistic negotiations. Thus, in managing a negotiation they attempt to identify a sympathetic counterpart oficial in a foreign government and work to cultivate a personal relationship, a sense of \"friendship\" (you-yi) and obligation; they then attempt to manipulate feelings of good will, obligation, guilt, or dependence to achieve their negotiating objectives. The frequently used term \"friendship\" implies to the Chinese a strong sense of obligation for the \"old friend\" to provide support and assistance to China. # THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS American officials have characterized negotiations with the PRC as a linear process of sequential and relatively discrete stages which unfold as the two sides explore issues of common concern. This process is illustrated in the following table: The Linear Process of PRC Political Negotiations <html><body><table><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td></td><td>(3)</td><td></td><td>(4)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Opening Moves \u2022 Establish a rela-</td><td></td><td>Period of Assessment</td><td>End Game</td><td></td><td>Implementation</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>tionship with a &quot;friendly&quot; counter- \u00b7 Apply pressures</td><td></td><td>\u2022 Draw out inter- locutor</td><td>\u2022 Conclude an agreement, or</td><td></td><td>\u2022 Press for adher- ence</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>part official Establish a favorable</td><td></td><td>Test intentions,</td><td>or</td><td></td><td>\u2022 Reserve position, \u2022 Make additional demands</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>agenda</td><td></td><td>patience</td><td>\u2022 Abort the nego- tiation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gain commitment to PRC &quot;principles&quot;</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html> # Opening Moves PRC officials make a determined effort at the outset of a negotiation to establish a sympathetic counterpart official as an interlocutor, to cultivate a personal relationship (friendship) with him; they press for the acceptance of their principles as the basis of the relationship.

[We] should \u2014 based on the joint fire strike campaign command SoS, and focusing on the characteristics of IO command and strength application and on the situation of the IO equipment levels [standards] {zhuangbei shuiping} and [end of page 274] IO strength task organization {liliang biancheng} \u2014 keep attention on the requirements for implementing unified command $\\{ t o n g y i z h i h u i \\}$ of the multidimensionally integrated {duoyuan yiti} IO strengths, and construct a joint fire strike campaign IO command SoS, so as to form composite strength $\\{ h e l i \\}$ . Within the campaign implementation process, [we] must comprehensively apply the methods of planned control {jihua kongzhi}, ad hoc control {linji kongzhi}, targeted control {mubiao kongzhi}, and time control, to ensure implementing stable and sustained C2 over IO. For major IO activities, [we] must put into effect highly centralized and unified {jizhong tongyi} planned control. The specific {juti} IO activities of all operational groups {zuozhan jituan}, with the ad hoc adjustment control mode {suiji tiaokong fangshi} as primary, are flexibly commanded by all operational groups. [We] must, based on each operational time segment\u2019s needs $\\{ x u q i u \\}$ for IO, implement flexible command and adjustment control, to ensure that the IO targets, activities, attack modes {gongji fangshi}, and attack key points are closely complemented by and mutually adjusted-coordinated with the mid- to long-range {zhongyuancheng} fire strike activities. # III. Focusing on weakening the enemy information system\u2019s integrated-whole operational capability, and precisely selecting the key point strike targets\u2026275 Within joint fire strike, the prominent superiority of the adversary in terms of networked information systems and reconnaissance and early warning, C2, and rapid reaction will constitute a serious threat to our missile and aircraft penetration. This not only is where the main backing lies for the high-speed operation {yunzhuan} of the enemy\u2019s air defense and anti-missile SoS, but also is its distinct \u201csoft rib.\u201d Hence, conducting suppression and destruction $\\{ h u i s h a n g \\}$ of its critical information nodes, sabotaging its orderly operation $\\{ y o u x u y u n x i n g \\}$ , and rendering it blind, uncontrollable, and unable to intercept {xiangkan kanbujian, xiang kongzhi buliao, xiang lanlan buzhu} [our missiles and aircraft] thus have become the most important missions of IO. Hence, [we] must firmly establish the consciousness of active attack [offensive] {jiji jingong}, comprehensively apply multiple information attack strengths, precisely select the key point strike IO targets, and use energetic and effective active attacks {zhudong jingong} and continuous attacks {lianxu jingong}. The key points are on conducting key point jamming and suppression and destruction and sabotage against the main targets within the enemy\u2019s reconnaissance and early warning, C2, and anti-missile and air defense information systems, such as ground-based satellite receiving stations, early warning aircraft, early warning radar stations {yujing leida zhan}, [Navy] observation and communication posts {guantong zhan}, C2 centers, communication hubs, microwave communication stations $\\{ w e i b o t o n g x i n z h a n \\}$ , and military satellite communication [facilities], as well as target indication radar {mubiao zhishi leida} and missile guidance radar {daodan zhidao leida} for air defense and anti-missile weaponry $\\{ b i n g q i \\}$ ; to the maximum extent weakening and sabotaging [end of page 275] the operational effectiveness of the important electronic information systems which support {zhicheng} the enemy\u2019s integrated-whole defensive operations SoS {zhengti fangwei zuozhan tixi}; and thus weakening the enemy\u2019s integrated-whole defensive operational capability, so as to create favorable conditions for other operational activities. # IV. Centering on \u201cbeing able to defend\u201d {\u201c\u9632\u5f97\u4f4f\u201d \u201cfangdezhu\u201d}, and establishing a rigorous {yanmi} information defense system SoS\u2026276 Within a joint fire strike campaign, maintaining the security of friendly information and information systems, and concealing our operational intention, are an important aspect in seizing information dominance. To this end, [we] must [implement] strict electromagnetic [EM] spectrum management {dianci pinpu guanli}, to ensure the security of the campaign core information circulation {xinxi liuzhuan} process and of all types of electronic information systems and their critical nodes. In particular, [we] must strengthen information defense of important information system nodes, such as command communication hubs, weapons guidance and control systems, and the main-direction radar stations and observation and communication stations, and strengthen defensive measures in respects such as psychological protection and information secrecy {baomi} for the fire strike units, to ensure the smooth implementation of the joint fire assault activities. [We] must, on the basis of enhancing concealment and camouflage {yinbi weizhuang}, engineering protection, diversion and deception {yangdong qipian}, and EM [spectrum] management, exert effort to strengthen the building of an information defense SoS within the integrated air defense SoS {zonghe fangkong tixi}. [We must] emphasize using attack to aid defense {yigong zhufang}, and using active $\\{ j i j i \\}$ information attack activities within air defense operations, to attack and destroy the enemy\u2019s air raid operations SoS {kongxi zuozhan tixi}; to weaken the enemy\u2019s two great superiorities , [viz.] \u201cnon-contact\u201d and \u201chigh-precision\u201d {\u201cfeijiechu,\u201d \u201cgaojingdu\u201d} [operations]; to gain the initiative in defense; and to ensure the battlefield survival and safety of our fire assault strengths, the normal operation of C2 systems, and the smooth implementation of the joint fire assault activities. # Section 3: Activities of Joint Fire Strike Campaign IO\u2026276 IO activities within a joint fire strike campaign should be carried out by centering on the campaign phases of preliminary strike {xianqi daji}, sustained strike {chixu daji}, and follow-up strike {houxu daji}. # I. IO activities in the preliminary strike phase\u2026276 Implementing IO in the preliminary strike phase mainly centers on the activities to seize local information dominance and air dominance/supremacy {zhikongquan} [end of page 276]. It should concentrate use of most of the information attack strengths within the task organization, to execute strikes against important information system targets, such as the enemy\u2019s command communication system, radar stations, and computer network nodes; spare no effort to seize local information dominance; and to the maximum extent degrade and even paralyze the operational effectiveness of the enemy information systems, so as to ensure the smooth conduct of our joint fire strike activities. The IO activities mainly are as follows: using information reconnaissance strengths to reconnoiter and evaluate-appraise the strike effects, so as to provide target information intelligence for sustained fire assault; using multiple information attack means such as electronic jammers {dianzi ganraoji}, long-distance assisting support jamming aircraft, and electronic jamming unmanned aerial vehicles [UAVs] {wurenji} to [conduct] key point jamming and sabotage of the air defense early warning and detection systems, C2 systems, communication networks, anti-missile interception systems, and airfield navigation systems within the enemy anti-missile SoS, so as to weaken the enemy\u2019s information acquisition, transmission, and processing capability and air-defense and antimissile operational capability; in the main assault direction, using anti-radiation weapons {fanfushe wuqi} and directed energy weapons [DEWs] {dingxiang neng wuqi} to attack the enemy airborne and sea-going reconnaissance and early warning platforms, so as to weaken the enemy\u2019s battlefield posture awareness capability and to assist-support and complement the fire strike activities of the missile, air, and naval operational groups; using network warfare strengths to execute attacks against the enemy computer network systems, so as to paralyze the enemy computer networks and sabotage the integrity {wanzhengxing} of the enemy operational SoS; and applying multiple information transmission media and psychological warfare [PSYWAR] {xinlizhan} weapons to execute psychological attacks against the enemy, so as to strengthen the shock effect of the missile strikes and boost the comprehensive benefit {zonghe xiaoyi} of the missile fire strikes. # II. IO activities in the sustained strike phase\u2026277 In the sustained strike phase, the main mission for IO is to use the mode of accompanied assisting support {bansui zhiyuan} to maintain information superiority and to assist-support the firepower\u2019s sustained strike; at the same time it must have defense against attack {\u5bd3\u9632\u4e8e\u653b $y u f a n g y u g o n g \\}$ , and defend against the enemy\u2019s information attacks $\\{ x i n x i g o n g j i \\}$ . The main operational activities are as follows: the information reconnaissance strengths rigorously surveil the battlefield posture and enemy situation changes, constantly indicate targets for the fire strike strengths, and brief $\\{ t o n g b a o \\}$ them on the situation and operational effects; the psychological operations [PSYOPS] {xinli zuozhan} strengths via various media execute high-intensity psychological attacks against the enemy, to enhance the shock quality {zhenhanxing} of the joint fire strikes; and the information deception strengths apply means such as information diversion {xinxi yangdong}, release of smoke screens, and spreading of metal chaff {jinshu botiao}, to screen the fire [end of page 277] strike strengths\u2019 assault on important targets in the enemy depth. At the same time, within the process of executing sustained fire strike, our information systems and facilities equipment $\\{ s h e b e i \\}$ will be subject to the enemy\u2019s fulldimensional {quanfangwei}, multilevel, multi-means information attacks and firepower sabotage/destruction. In order to weaken to the maximum extent the enemy attack effects, [we] should adopt comprehensive measures, including EM emission {dianci fushe} control, information hiding {xinxi yinni}, electronic camouflage {dianzi weizhuang}, engineering protection, firepower screening, and using attack to aid defense, to strengthen information protection, and to defend against the ground, sea, air, and even outer space {taikong} information reconnaissance and information attacks executed against us by the enemy, to ensure the normal bringing into play of our information systems\u2019 effectiveness and the smooth conduct of the fire strikes. # III. IO activities in the follow-up strike phase\u2026278 Implementing IO in the follow-up strike phase mainly centers on the campaign activities of supplementing $\\{ b u c h o n g \\}$ and expanding the fire strikes. On the basis of the previous phase\u2019s network sabotage and severing of links $\\{$ \u7834\u7f51\u65ad\u94fe powang duanlian}, [our strengths will] conduct key point jamming and suppression and destruction and sabotage of the remaining and newly detected important information targets of the enemy, to maintain battlefield local information dominance, and to assist-support and complement the follow-up fire strike activities. Based on operational needs and requirements $\\{ x u y a o \\}$ , [we will] at the right time apply network attack means to conduct infiltration $\\{ s h e n t o u \\}$ and sabotage of various types of network systems which maintain $\\{ w e i x i \\}$ war potential {zhanzheng qianli}. [We will] apply power grid {dianwang} attack weapons; watch the situation [for an opportunity] to sabotage the enemy\u2019s electric power system; and at the right time jam and sabotage the enemy\u2019s civilian radio $\\{ g u a n g b o \\}$ , television, and telecommunications systems, to weaken the enemy\u2019s capability for assisting support to sustained operations {zhiyuan chixu zuozhan de nengli}.

In particular, the WeChat public number of the comment department represents the voice of the organization, and online comments can have a wide impact, making it an unbearable burden for many media outlets. As interviewee D put it: \"Individuals can 2015NO.5 (General 387) 1994-2022 China AcademicJournalElectronic Publishinghouse. allrights reserved. lit. collect and edit light art Second. Most media have not established a clear system of rewards and punishments for the operation of WeChat, resulting in insufficient motivation to open and operate the program. Unlike the editors of traditional comment boards, the operation of WeChat public numbers has to take into account the language expression characteristics and dissemination mechanism of new media platforms in addition to the selection and writing of articles, requiring more energy to interact with the users and requiring commentators to master more new media skills, which is a human and material resource constraint to the opening of WeChat public numbers of comment boards in media organizations. In addition, some media organizations focus their efforts on building aPP, which already includes a commentary section, such as the Oriental Morning Post's \"Surge\", in which case there is little incentive for the commentary department to do another WeChat public number. In terms of commentators' personal WeChat public numbers, of the 17 media commentaries interviewed, six media outlets, including Beijing Youth Daily, Yangtze River Daily, Oriental Morning Post, Nanfang Daily, Huashang Daily, and the Channel Herald, did not have any personal WeChat public numbers for their commentators. The other 11 media outlets did have personal WeChat public numbers, with the most in the Southern Metropolis Daily, which had five, and two media outlets with non- commentary personal WeChat public numbers for their commentators. There are also two media outlets whose commentators have opened personal WeChat public numbers that are not commentaries. In terms of part-time jobs, the Huashang Daily has a system that does not allow commentators to accept part-time jobs, but the Yangcheng Evening News agrees and encourages commentators to be hired to participate in a variety of activities, such as lecturing at colleges and universities, or serving as judges and guests of honor; and the commentary department of the Southern Metropolis Daily has always cooperated closely with public welfare organizations, and its commentators and Beijing-based commentators have participated in public welfare organizations. I can write and express myself more freely. However, the department's public number is subject to very strict censorship and regulation, which means that the organization itself is very cautious in all aspects.\" 3. \u0000 In fact, even if some media review departments have opened their WeChat public numbers, they are careful to \"cut\" their names from the organizations they work for to avoid unnecessary trouble, for example, the WeChat public number of the Southern Metropolis Daily is called \"Difficulty\". According to interviewee c, \"This is a glimpse of the dilemma of the so-called transformation of traditional media. The influence that traditional media have accumulated in the past does not play any role in WeChat communication. Instead, the institution itself has become a liability, most notably in terms of the scale of expression, which is still restricted by the institution, albeit slightly more lenient than newspapers, but far less flexible than individuals. In this sense, WeChat is de-institutionalized. Interviewee G agrees, arguing that institutional commentary is \"too restricted, and individual speech does not need to take too many factors into account\". Third, for individual commentators, they prefer to speak through their WeChat public numbers, which is more flexible and conducive to personal branding. Currently, the media does not require commentators to report their personal WeChat public numbers to the organization like they report their personal microblog accounts. Commentators' comments on WeChat public numbers are at their own risk and less linked to the organization, which makes them freer to speak than on microblogs; moreover, the reward function of WeChat public numbers can also help commentators to develop a new income- generating channel to a certain extent. Changes Chinese News Commentary Media Convergence  Based on Interviews 17 Media Commentators 2015_zh Page 4 of 7 http://www.cnki.net Secondly, WeChat has further leveled the playing field for individual operators. 1994-2022 China AcademicJournalElectronic Publishinghouse. allrights reserved. II. Personnel: from traditional to new media O picking and editing light art 1. Depth of views: insightful, informative, sharp, in-depth; 2. Scarcity of views: original, unique, non-mainstream insights; 3. Timeliness of expression: timely, the first time to express their views. The hotspots are well captured; 39 4. style of expression: naughty, funny language, innovative writing style; 5. relevance to oneself: sponsored by one's own ministry; However, compared with individual WeChat, institutional WeChat also has its own advantages, such as more stable article quality, relatively abundant resources, and guaranteed publication cycle. Under the circumstance of rich and diversified subjects of speech and the rise of self-media, there is still a significance for media organizations to express their voices through commentaries, and media commentaries departments should recognize this problem and think about how to make their voices and positions influence more audiences. The difference between WeChat and institutional operations is that all WeChat public numbers are equally \"collapsed\" into the \"subscription\" of WeChat users and are presented in the order in which they are pushed out, unlike microblogging platforms that offer certification or promotion services to institutional users. Moreover, for many netizens, they do not care whether a public number is run by an individual or a team, but rather the content and opinions provided by the WeChat public number. In addition, the main factors mentioned by the reviewers who gave reasons for recommending WeChat are: 3. The proliferation of self-publishers and the increasing diversity of commentators and comment standards When summarizing the recommended microblogs for personal commentary, it was found that the most mentioned by commentators was \"Old News Commentary\", 7 times; followed by \"Wang Wusi\", 4 times; and \"Poisonous Tongue's Poison\", 3 times. The second was \"Wang Wu Si\", 4 times; the third was \"Poisonous Tongue of Poison\", 3 times. From the above summary, we can see First, the earlier the WeChat public number is opened, the more advantageous it is in terms of influence, because it has accumulated a certain influence before other WeChat public numbers appeared, and has maintained this influence relatively stably in its subsequent operation, such as \"Unity Lake Reference\" (\u56e2\u7ed3\u6e56\u53c2\u8003), \"Old News Review\" (\u65e7\u95fb\u8bc4\u8bba). \"Old News Review\". Moreover, the definition of news commentaries on new media platforms is further blurred, and many articles cannot be called news commentaries in the strict sense of the word. They have a larger scale of expression, are more personalized, and are more adept at using pictures, videos, cartoons, and other means to enhance their persuasive effect. In summarizing the institutions or organizations recommended by the interviewees, it was found that \"Lake Unity Reference\" was mentioned most frequently by the commentators, with a total of 8 times; followed by \"Chivalrous Island\", with 3 times; \"Maritime Warehouse Insider \"Zhigu Trend\", \"Xinjing Newspaper Review\" and \"Boiling\" were all mentioned 2 times; others such as \"People's Daily Review\" and \"Jin Jin\" were mentioned 2 times. Commentary\", \"Jintai 2\", \"Elephant Guild\", \"What to do\", \"Knowledge Bureau Others, such as \"People's Daily Commentary,\" \"Jintai 2,\" \"Elephant Guild,\" \"What's Up,\" \"Knowledge Bureau,\" \"Media Notes,\" \"Wu Xiaobo Channel,\" \"CCTV News,\" \"Everyone,\" \"Consensus.com,\" and \"The New York Times,\" have been published twice. \"Consensus\", \"Difficulty\", \"Zhixia Forum\", \"Red Pepper\", etc. were all mentioned only once. etc. were mentioned only once. From Table 2, we can see that the scale of commentaries in traditional media is not large, except for Beijing Youth Daily, Yangtze River Daily, Southern Metropolis Daily and People's Daily, which have more than 10 people in their commentaries, the number of commentators and editors in other media is in the single digit, with the smallest ones, such as The Straits Herald (which doesn't have a commentaries department) and Xinxin Express, having only one full-time commentator in their commentaries. With such a size of commentary team, it is difficult to arrange enough manpower to deliver the voice of the media's commentary department to the Internet, in addition to completing the task of editing and writing the commentary pages of the daily paper edition. In the interview, the author learned that many commentators do not pay special attention to those public numbers for commentaries. When asked what personal or institutional microblogs for commentaries are worth recommending (there is no limit to the number of microblogs), a commentator said bluntly, \"There is nothing to recommend, I think everyone has different tastes and interests and pays attention to different public numbers. Personally, I like public numbers that are a bit more literary, a bit more life-oriented, and a bit farther away from the hot topics. I'm already close to the hotspots when I do my daily commentary, and I hope my life can be farther away from the news.\" (Interviewee H) 6.

The Soviet Union\u2019s Cosmos-1370 satellite was adjusted two days later to a position where it could observe this gradually escalating war. Based on a similar goal, the Soviet Union\u2019s Cosmos-1377 satellite also flew through the space above the Middle East region from 12 to 16 June, and it transmitted the intelligence that it obtained to Syria and other countries, which had no way to conduct aerial and space reconnaissance, so that they could resist Israel. On 1 November 1982, Iraq launched a new attack against Iran. Soviet spy satellites were quickly turned toward the space above this region. When Cosmos-1419 flew past the battlefield on 5 November, it slowed down, and for the next two days continued to reconnoiter. Cosmos-1421 also continually paid attention to every move and every action in the Persian Gulf, providing intelligence about the combatant countries. 4. The use of space operations in the British-Argentine Falkland Islands War On 4 March 1982, the Falkland Islands War, which caught the world\u2019s attention, broke out between the United Kingdom and Argentina; the start of the war originated in Argentina\u2019s desire to take back the Falkland Islands from the hands of the British. The British, on the other hand, wanted to recover these islands, which had just been occupied by Argentina. In the background of this war, the United States and the Soviet Union staged an intense space intelligence battle. US relations with the United Kingdom were close, and intelligence from satellite reconnaissance naturally was provided to the United Kingdom. And when the United States sanctioned exports of cereals to the Soviet Union, Argentina sold cereals to the Soviet Union, so that it could be seen that the SovietArgentine relationship was not an ordinary one; in order to thank Argentina for its timely assistance, the Soviet Union used intelligence from satellite reconnaissance as a repayment. After the Falkland Islands War broke out, the Soviet Union launched thirteen spy satellites, one after the other; eight of these were radar satellites and five were communications satellites. [The Soviets] primarily used the Cosmos-1347 satellite to carry out reconnaissance and to obtain military intelligence about the British forces. From the departure of the British task force from Portsmouth Harbor straight through to its arrival at the Falkland Islands, Soviet satellites continually closely tracked and monitored it. Afterwards, the Soviet Union also launched military satellites; among them, Cosmos1352 was especially for use in the Falkland Islands War. At the same time that it supplied the Argentine military with intelligence, the Soviets also did not forget their own country\u2019s interests. On 2 April 1982, the British forces were about to land on the Falkland Islands; that day, the Soviet Union launched the Cosmos1347 satellite, in order to reconnoiter how the war was progressing. This satellite was a high-resolution reconnaissance satellite, and it twice flew past the area where the British task force was stationed \u2013 Portsmouth Harbor. After two days, when the main forces of the task force had already completed their preparations for war, and when they were going to put to sea the next morning, this satellite again flew over Portsmouth Harbor, with the goal of wanting to clarify whether or not, as many people at that time had guessed, there was a nuclear submarine in the fleet, and in order to make it easy to provide a military service to the Soviet military and the Warsaw Pact countries. In regard to this, the United States was unwilling to show weakness. At this time, the United States used twenty-four maritime surveillance satellites to provide intelligence support to the United Kingdom and to assist the United Kingdom in sinking Argentina\u2019s cruiser General Belgrado. The Soviet Union used thirty-seven reconnaissance satellites to provide information support for Argentina; the Argentine air force utilized intelligence information provided by Soviet reconnaissance satellites to use an Exocet missile to unexpectedly sink a fairly advanced British missile cruiser [sic], the Sheffield. The Falkland Islands War ultimately came to an end, with Argentina losing because of a great disparity in actual military strengths, but the US-Soviet space battle still continued. # II. The practical applications of space operations in the middle period...191 The several local wars since 1991 have exhibited a great many characteristics that differ from previous wars, so that the shape of war is silently undergoing fundamental and comprehensive changes. Of these, the change that has most caught people\u2019s attention is that military applications in the space sphere have already developed to a brand-new stage; space strengths have begun to comprehensively get involved in local wars, forming a new form of operations. 1. Applications of space operations in the Gulf War The 1991 Gulf War was a classic example of high-tech local warfare, as well as a landmark example where space operations were used to initially form combat strengths. The multinational force headed by the United States, in order to gain victory in the war, made use of space strengths that had become rudimentarily mature in order to provide support-style operations throughout the entire course [of the war], using more than seventy satellites, 118 mobile satellite ground stations, twelve commercial satellite terminals, eighty-one satellite information switches, 329 telephone circuits, thirty message circuits, 30,000 radio frequencies, and 40,000 computers to establish a huge space information collection, transmission, processing, and distribution system. For the first time, it showed the world the powerful information support capability of space strengths, and it had an enormous impact on the course of the war and made important contributions to victory in the Gulf War. After the war, when the US military summarized its experience in the Gulf War, it believed that speaking in a certain sense, the Gulf War was \u201cthe first space war\u201d in human history, and that \u201cthe Gulf War proved that space weapons systems have become an indispensable part of the system of modern operations, regardless of whether this is in strategic actions or in tactical actions.\u201d The various kinds of military satellites (see Table 7-1) that the United States used in the Gulf War provided information support for operations at all times and spaces, in all time domains, and in all directions, in a highly efficient manner. The four great systems that they formed, for space reconnaissance and surveillance, space communications support, space navigation and positioning, and space weather support, provided high-quality, urgently needed, and reliable information for operations; this was used on a large scale by the multinational force in the war, and it vigorously supported joint operations on the ground.

It also had three Fleet Communications satellites and one Leasat-3 assume the task of naval communications. And the British military used the Skynet-4 satellite, and the French military used Syracuse military communications circuits on the Telecommunications-1A and the Telecommunications-1C. Satellite communications made up eighty-five percent of the total amount of internal and external communications in the theater of war. In order to provide operational units with precise navigation and positioning information, the United States deployed eighteen GPS-2A global navigation and positioning system satellites in outer space. The ground operations units, aircraft, ships, and special operations units of the multinational force had approximately 5,500 military positioning and navigation receivers as well as 10,000 civilian receivers; these could receive highly precise three-dimensional navigation and positioning signals for more than twenty hours every day. GPS receivers were installed on precision-guided weapons, and these were effective in enhancing the accuracy of the weapons\u2019 strikes and their attack capabilities. Assisted by these accurate navigation and positioning signals, F-16 [Fighting Falcon] fighters, B-52 [Stratofortress] bombers, and RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft could carry out their military missions accurately and without error in all weathers; tank formations could carry out precision movements in the desert zones that had no landform characteristics; minesweeping units could safely pass through minefields and accurately determine the locations of mines in order to make it easy to destroy these; and supply transportation vehicles could find combat personnel in the desert and provide them with supplies. In naval operations and in supporting busy ocean shipping, GPS enabled naval ships and the large number of commercial vessels carrying supplies to get accurate navigation and positioning. The multinational force used imagery reconnaissance satellites to carry out all-weather reconnaissance against important targets like Iraq\u2019s command centers, airfields, Scud missile launchers, air defense missile batteries, and communications nodes, and they used \u201cland\u201d satellites and two French SPOT satellites to do general surveys with rather low resolution over broad areas; the information that was obtained played an important role in large-scale air raids and ground operations. Imagery reconnaissance also had the task of evaluating and appraising the results of bombing and destruction against targets, and they provided a basis for determining the time when ground units would launch assaults. The multinational force used electronic reconnaissance satellites and other land, sea, and air reconnaissance platforms together to create a three-dimensional reconnaissance intelligence system to closely reconnoiter Iraq\u2019s electromagnetic spectrum activities, to collect its signal characteristics and parameters, to ascertain the various frequency band signals, and to thus carry out support for electronic warfare operations. Electronic reconnaissance satellites listened in on the Iraqi military\u2019s most important radio communications channels, including the channels used by Iraqi President Saddam [Hussein] and senior commanders in the Republican Guard and the channels used by the Iraqi military\u2019s military command organizations\u2019 communications network, so that the multinational force was able to stay abreast of any major military actions by the Iraqi military. The United States used two Defense Support Program (NSP) [sic] early warning satellites to detect launch conditions for Iraqi Scud missiles and to provide four to five minutes of early warning to residents in Israel and to the units deployed in Saudi Arabia (Scud missiles\u2019 flight time was about seven minutes). At the same time, they provided crucially important early warning data for Patriot anti-missile systems to intercept [the Scuds], thus creating a precedent for ground interception weapons to carry out actual combat in missile interception.", "metadata": "2022-08-12 Lectures on the Science of Space Operations.md", "judgement": true}, "4": {"text": "Secrecy & Stratagem: Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture Thomas G. Mahnken To cope with a rising China, other powers will need a close understanding of Chinese strategic culture. This paper presents an initial attempt to redress this gap. It seeks to identify the enduring features of Chinese strategic culture, assess their role in Chinese policy, and consider their implications for the future posture and responses of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Drawing on ancient texts, modern official documents and accounts of Beijing\u2019s decision-making during crises, Secrecy & Stratagem raises important questions about the potentially risky relationship between Chinese strategic culture, misperception and miscalculation in Asia\u2019s uncertain security future. Secrecy and Stratagem: Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture Thomas G. Mahnken February 2011 Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture Contents Introduction Defining Strategic Culture National Strategic Culture Military Strategic Culture Topics for Further Study Notes References Secrecy and Stratagem 1. Introduction It appears that the United States is in a military competition with China that, for planning purposes, can be assumed to go on for the foreseeable future. As the 2008 National Defense Strategy states, \u201cThe Department will respond to China\u2019s expanding military power, and to the uncertainties over how it might be used, through shaping and hedging. This approach tailors investment of substantial, though not infinite, resources in ways that favor key enduring U.S. advantages. At the same time, we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to China if necessary.\u201d To have any hope of success, any strategy for dealing with China over the long term should be based upon an understanding both of the United States\u2019 enduring strengths and weaknesses and those of China. These features should flow from sources that are immutable, such as geography, or that change slowly and predictably, such as culture or demography. During the Cold War, the United States over time developed a good understanding of key features of Soviet strategic culture. These features, which included the imperative of defending the Russian Motherland (Rodina) from attack and a centralised style of command and control, served as the basis for strategy development and force modernisation. For example, recognition of the importance that the Soviet government placed on defending the Motherland, manifested in the existence of national air defence forces (Protivovozdushnoi Oborony Strany, or PVO Strany) as a separate service with high levels of investment in air defence, informed U.S. decisions to maintain a manned penetrating bomber force as well as develop new systems such as the B-2 stealth bomber. The United States currently lacks a similar appreciation of the main tenets of Chinese strategic culture. This paper presents an initial attempt to redress this gap. In particular, it seeks to understand the enduring features of Chinese strategic culture, develop indicators that could be used to validate whether these features are indeed operative and enduring, and explicate potential implications of these features for strategy development. It is based upon three types of evidence: (1) translations of both ancient Chinese texts on strategy, such as Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War, and a sampling of modern official documents, such as the Chinese defence white papers and The Science of Military Strategy; (2) analyses of Chinese strategic culture by American, French, and Chinese scholars; and (3) other evidence, such as accounts of Chinese crisis decision-making and patterns of military deployments. There are two compelling reasons to study Chinese strategic culture. First, it may give us insight into Chinese decision-making. Indeed, it may help us understand behaviour that on the face of it seems irrational. Moreover, certain features of strategic culture may promote misperception. For example, one would expect a state possessing a highly ethnocentric strategic culture to overestimate its capabilities relative to those of potential adversaries. A second reason to study Chinese strategic culture is that the Chinese themselves see it as an important determinant of their behaviour and that of others. Indeed, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) has published a book on the subject entitled Analysis of China\u2019s Strategic Culture, which explores Chinese strategic culture in depth and contrasts it with \u201cWestern\u201d strategic culture. In the words of Lieutenant General Li Jijun, the former Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, \u201cCulture is the root and foundation of strategy. Strategic thinking, in the process of its evolutionary history, flows into the mainstream of a country or a nation\u2019s strategic culture. Each country or nation\u2019s strategic culture cannot but bear the imprint of cultural traditions, which, in a subconscious and complex way, prescribes and defines strategy making.\u201d Similarly, the authors of the Chinese handbook The Science of Military Strategy argue that, \u201cStrategic thought is always formed on the basis of certain historical and national cultural tradition, and formulation and performance of strategy by strategists are always controlled and driven by certain cultural ideology and historical cultural complex.\u201d Most Chinese military leaders believe that ancient Chinese values and warfighting principles remain relevant today. Ancient Chinese philosophical texts, military treatises such as The Art of War and the Seven Military Classics of Ancient China, and literary classics such as Journey to the West and The Water Margin are central to the identity of the PLA. The PLA teaches that its members are heirs to an ancient Chinese legacy and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s revolutionary struggles. PLA military handbooks routinely refer to battles fought 4,000 years ago as object lessons, and PLA leaders seek guidance from 2,500-year-old writings for modern operations. Indeed, even today, Chinese officers freely distribute translations of the Chinese military classics to their hosts. Chinese strategists also view others as possessing their own unique strategic culture. For example, they contrast an expansionist, bellicose \u201cWestern\u201d way of war with what they see as their own pacifist tradition. Organisation of this paper Chapter 2 begins by defining the concept of strategic culture and discussing challenges to operationalising it. Chapter 3 describes the four tenets of China\u2019s national strategic culture: \u2022 China is culturally superior \u2022 China\u2019s natural position is that of the \u201cMiddle Kingdom\u201d \u2022 China must be unified internally and free from external meddling, and \u2022 war is costly, destructive, and leads to internal dissension. Chapter 4 describes the four tenets of China\u2019s military strategic culture: \u2022 safeguarding Chinese territorial integrity is an important military mission \u2022 the goal of strategy is to exploit the propensity of things, or shi, \u2022 to achieve one\u2019s objectives war is a scientific process, and through secrecy and stratagem, \u2022 it is possible to achieve a decisive victory against a superior adversary Chapter 5 contains recommendations for further research. Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture 2. Defining Strategic Culture The literature examining culture and its application to international affairs is rich. The sociologist Clifford Geertz, for example, defined culture as a \u201csystem of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes towards life.\u201d Similarly, Jack Snyder has termed culture \u201ca set of semi-permanent elite beliefs, attitudes, and behavior patterns socialized into a distinctive mode of thought.\u201d Definitions of strategic culture similarly vary somewhat. Andrew Scobell has defined it as \u201ca persistent system of values held in common by the leaders or group of leaders of a state concerning the use of military force.\u201d The Defense Threat Reduction Agency\u2019s Comparative Strategic Cultures project proposed that strategic cultures consist of \u201cshared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.\u201d This paper adopts Alastair Iain Johnston\u2019s definition of strategic culture as an integrated \u201csystem of symbols (e.g., argumentation structures, analogies, metaphors) which acts to establish pervasive and long-lasting strategic preferences by formulating concepts of the role and efficacy of military force in interstate political affairs, and by clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the strategic preferences seem uniquely realistic and efficacious.\u201d Or in other words, strategic culture consists of a limited, consistently ranked set of preferences that is persistent over time. Culture thus closely resembles the cognitive and motivational biases discussed in political science literature. The line between culture and cognitive processes is less distinct than was once thought. Recent research by Richard E. Nisbett and others challenges the long-held belief that cognitive processes are universal. To the contrary, Nisbett and his colleagues have provided some evidence that the considerable social differences that exist between cultures affect not only beliefs about specific aspects of the world but also the nature of cognitive processes. Social organization directs attention to certain aspects of reality at the expense of others. What people pay attention to, in turn, affects their beliefs about the functioning of the world and causality. For example, whereas Western civilisation is dominated by personal agency, Chinese culture emphasizes reciprocal social obligation and collective agency. The Chinese believe that people are part of a collective and that the behavior of the individual should be guided by group expectations. Nisbett\u2019s research shows that cultural traditions in general influence systems of thought, and that Asians in particular possess systems of thought that are highly influenced by their holistic cultural tradition. In a series of psychological experiments, Nisbett and Takahiko Masuda showed that Asians, more than Americans, explain events in their context. In separate research, Nisbett and Incheol Choi have shown that Asians, because of their holistic reasoning, take inconsistency for granted and are consequently less likely than Americans to experience surprise. Strategic cultures may share features. For example, just because a belief in the efficacy of deception is a feature of Chinese strategic culture, it does not follow that such a belief is uniquely Chinese. Other cultures, such as that of Persia (Iran), also put great weight on stratagem. Similarly, just because culture is influential, it is not necessarily determinative. As Alexander L. George wrote forty years ago, culture \u201cinfluences, but does not unilaterally determine, decision-making; it is an important, but not the only, variable that shapes decision-making behavior.\u201d Or, as the Chinese military authors Peng Guangqian and Yao Youzhi put it, \u201cCulture is not tantamount to behavior, nor is tradition to realities. However, cultural tradition, no doubt, may influence on choice of behavior in realities.\u201d Key to understanding strategic culture, therefore, is understanding just how much of an effect strategic culture has on behavior. Culture must, of course, be applied carefully. Not to do so \u201crisks replacing strategy with stereotypes,\u201d as Patrick Porter observed. One of the central challenges that the student of any nation\u2019s strategic culture faces is determining which institutions serve as the keeper and transmitter of strategic culture. Is it the state? The military as a whole? Or some subset of the military? Another challenge lies in identifying the content of strategic culture, the most salient beliefs and attitudes that make up culture. Last but not least is the challenge of determining the extent to which strategic culture, rather than power considerations, actually determines attitudes and behavior. One particular challenge in dealing with Chinese strategic culture involves disentangling how Chinese leaders portray themselves from how they act. As Andrew Scobell has noted, most Chinese elites believe that China possesses a uniquely pacifistic strategic culture, that China has never been an expansionist state, and that China has never fought an aggressive war in its history. The stereotypical view of China adopted by scholars in China, as well as in the West, is one of a state possessing a weak martial tradition and a cultural predisposition to seek non-violent solutions to problems of state. However, this self-image has not always influenced practice. As Warren I. Cohen has observed, \u201cIn the creation of their empire, the Chinese were no less arrogant, no less ruthless, than the Europeans, Japanese, or Americans in the creation of theirs.\u201d Rather, successive generations of Chinese scholars created a narrative that shows that foreign nations have long sought to deny China its sovereignty. At the military strategic level, this narrative argues that the PLA saved China from foreign aggression and domestic tyranny and prevented more powerful adversaries from interfering in Chinese affairs. The military narrative stresses that China has only fought when forced to do so, and has always fought in a defensive and moral fashion. It also highlights the fact that the PLA has won every war even when it faced more advanced adversaries. Alastair Iain Johnston\u2019s careful work on the Ming period (1368\u20131644) concluded, however, that no pacifist bias appeared in the Chinese strategic tradition. By contrast, China\u2019s leaders operated according to the dictates of Realpolitik even if they often cloaked their actions in Confucian rationalizations.", "metadata": "Mahnken - Secrecy & Stratagem-cl.docx", "judgement": true}, "5": {"text": "The Kosovo War pushed IO toward a new development phase. During the Kosovo War, the US military, besides applying traditional EW means, also widely employed a good many new-concept weapons {xin gainian wuqi} to execute crushing strikes {huimiexing daji} on the information systems and electric power systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] {\u5357\u8054\u76df nan lian meng}. For example, it repeatedly used conventional EM pulse bombs [E-bombs] {dianci maichong dan}, leading to \u201clarge-area paralysis\u201d of the FRY\u2019s electronic information systems. The US military also for the first time used carbon-fiber graphite bombs {tan xianwei shimo zhadan} to specially strike at and sabotage the FRY\u2019s electric power systems. After this type of bomb exploded in the air, it could produce large quantities of long thin carbonfiber strips; once these strips fell onto high-voltage transmission lines or transformers, they could create short-circuits, and thus incinerate the power transmission equipment and paralyze the electric power system. It is thus clear that new-concept weapons became a new means of EW. In [the history of] human war, the Kosovo War was the first large-scale war reported over the Internet {hulianwang}. As soon as the war began, NATO exploited the Internet, and repeatedly at great length {\u8fde\u7bc7\u7d2f\u724d lianpian leidu} reported the so-called true state of the war $\\{ z h a n z h e n g z h e n x i a n g \\}$ , to prepare the public {\u9e23\u9523\u5f00\u9053 mingluo kaidao} for the war\u2019s actions $\\{ x i n g j i n g \\}$ . Simultaneously with this, the FRY, in order to counterattack {fanji} NATO\u2019s propaganda warfare, also exploited Internet sites {zhandian} to constantly transmit its own voice to the entire world. Via the Internet, it in good time transmitted NATO\u2019s savage acts {baoxing} in the war onto networks, and sent out reconnaissance information consistent with the identifying characteristics {shibie biaoshi} of its information and intelligence systems. [end of page 39] At the same time, the FRY fabricated its own battlefield information and projected false intelligence {jiaqingbao} to deceive the coming enemy. The FRY military also fully exploited NATO\u2019s abundant Internet information resources, over the \u2018Net collected information resources on the weapons and equipment of all NATO nations which participated in the air raid activities, and thus provided powerful assisting support $\\{ z h i y u a n \\}$ for its anti-air raid operations. In addition, ever since NATO had first launched air raids against the FRY, NATO\u2019s official website $\\{ g u a n f a n g w a n g z h a n \\}$ had constantly suffered attacks by computer hackers $\\lbrace h e i k e \\rbrace$ . Several computer warriors $\\{$ \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6597\u58eb jisuanji doushi} of the FRY exploited computer software, sneaked into NATO\u2019s server connecting to the Internet, and within a short time injected several thousand illicit pieces of information, which caused problems such as the NATO website appearing to be blocked $\\{ d u s e \\}$ and user access {yonghu fangwen} having difficulty. NATO\u2019s internal $\\{ n e i b u \\}$ e-mail system also was honored with hacker [intrusions], and every day it received more than 2000 \u201celectronic bombs\u201d {\u201cdianzi zhadan\u201d} of illicit mail. According to a NATO spokesperson who declined to reveal his or her name, during the war some of NATO\u2019s computer websites had suffered heavy losses {zhongchuang} inflicted by computer viruses {jisuanji bingdu} coming from the FRY. News reports said that FRY computer experts, under the assistance of Russian hackers, had once attacked into the C2 system of the US Navy\u2019s Nimitz aircraft carrier {\u201cNimizi\u201d hao hangkong mujian $\\}$ , and caused its communication to be out of order $\\{ s h i l i n g \\}$ for up to several hours. In addition, the US FBI\u2019s website and other government websites also suffered the attacks of hackers, causing several websites for long periods to be in a closed status {zhuangtai}. The great network war $\\{ w a n g l u o \\ d a z h a n \\}$ which broke out during the Kosovo War broke new records in the operational patterns within humankind\u2019s recorded history of war. The adoption of multiple means to implement PSYWAR was another prominent feature of the Kosovo War. The U.S.-led NATO\u2019s tactics $\\left\\{ c e l u e \\right\\}$ of \u201ctroops who subdue the enemy without battle\u201d {\u201c\u4e0d\u6218\u800c\u5c48\u4eba\u4e4b\u5175\u201d \u201cbuzhan er quren zhibing\u201d} already had its proponents {\u60c5\u6709\u72ec\u949f qingyou duzhong}, who fully recognized the principle of \u201cto take the enemy by force, first capture their hearts\u201d {\u201c\u593a\u4eba\u5148\u593a\u5fc3\u201d \u201cduoren xian duoxin\u201d}, and placed PSYWAR in an important position. At the beginning of April [1999], Britain\u2019s Foreign Secretary [Robin] Cook {\u5e93\u514b kuke} in a public address said that the FRY\u2019s First Lady Mila and her children had quietly left Yugoslavia and gone to another country. This sensational {\u8038\u4eba\u542c\u95fb songren tingwen} news was transmitted to Yugoslavia, and naturally played a certain role in confusing the people. This is because if it were really just as Cook had said, then it meant that Milosevic {\u7c73\u6d1b\u820d\u7ef4\u5947 miluosheweiqi} had already made preparations for defeat. On 27 May, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia [ICTY] {\u524d\u5357\u56fd\u9645\u6218\u72af\u6cd5\u5ead qiannan guoji zhanfan fating} inspector [Louise] Arbour {\u963f\u5c14\u5207\u5c14 aerqieer} announced that she was prosecuting for war crimes Milosevic and four other former Yugoslavian leaders. [end of page 40] This also was a new product of the PSYWAR cooked up {paozhi} by the leaders of the U.S., UK, and other nations. Its intent $\\{ y i t u \\}$ was unusually clear: to isolate the FRY leaders and to create in them enormous psychological fright {xinli konghuang}. When carrying out the campaign operations-research-based planning {zhanyi chouhua}, they considered PSYWAR content and objectives {mubiao} within it. At the start of the air raids, almost 100 personnel of the $4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ PSYWAR Group {dadui} $[ 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ PSYOP Group] subordinate to the US Special Operations Command [SOCOM] {tezhong zuozhan silingbu} at top speed were moved from the U.S. to Italy. Some [members] even penetrated deep into the Kosovar \u201cAlbanian Liberation Army\u2019s\u201d [KLA\u2019s] {\u79d1\u7d22\u6c83 \u201c\u963f\u65cf \u89e3\u653e\u519b\u201d kesuowo \u201cazu jiefangjun\u201d} controlled area, drew up {niding} PSYWAR activities courses of action [COAs] {xingdong fang\u2019an}, and conducted a multilevel, fulldimensional PSYWAR offensive $\\{ g o n g s h i \\}$ against Yugoslavia. First, they set up the \u201cNATO PSYWAR Broadcast TV Station.\u201d This group recommended that the US Air Force [USAF] dispatch 6 EC-130 aircraft. At an altitude of 10,000 meters, group personnel exploited the medium-wave and FM bands {zhongbu, tiaopin boduan} used by Yugoslav State radio and TV stations, and in the Serbian language broadcast PSYWAR information. Next, together with the NATO International Military Staff HQ {canmoubu} Public Relations Department, as well as related intelligence institutions, they joined hands to prepare PSYWAR propaganda materials and false information {jiaxinxi}, which they widely sent out to the mass media. In addition, based on PSYWAR tenets, they recommended strikes on susceptible targets $\\{ m i n g a n m u b i a o \\}$ , including the Yugoslavian president\u2019s official residence and bombing of the Yugoslavian electric power and water supply systems. In order to keep the Yugoslavian people from timely obtaining true information on the air raids and anti-air raid [activities], NATO before dawn on 23 April bombed the Yugoslav State TV station, and on the $2 7 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ it used missiles to destroy the TV broadcasting tower mounted at the top of the Serbian Socialist Party\u2019s HQ building. The main characteristics of IO at this time were as follows: first is that IO had become an important component of the joint campaign. IO had become the \u201cfirst gun\u201d fired in an independent phase of the joint campaign, even before the launch of the joint campaign\u2019s overall activities {zongti xingdong}; it moreover penetrated from start to finish of the entire campaign. This [point] had a typical embodiment within the Persian Gulf War and Kosovo War. Second is that IO technology had produced qualitative leaps: various types of IO weapons had emerged in an endless stream {\u5c42\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a77 cengchu buqiong}, and informationized weapons had become \u201cmultipliers\u201d of combat power. During the Kosovo War, the sorties into action {chudongde jiaci} by the NATO armed forces\u2019 EW aircraft constituted more than $40 \\%$ of the total number of aircraft sent into action. In addition, the \u201cdecoys\u201d towed by aircraft conducted air raids, and also acquitted themselves splendidly during the war. One new type of IO weapon \u2013 the EMP bomb [Ebomb] \u2013 [end of page 41] saw application in real combat. Third is the maturation of IO thought and the proposal of integrated {wanzheng} IO theory, as well as the establishment of the corresponding institutions. Before the Gulf War, studies of IO only involved individual efforts $\\{ x i n g w e i \\}$ sporadically carried out by theorists within and outside of the militaries of various nations; but after this war, they then became studies by the nation\u2019s leading [researchers] $\\left\\{ z h u d a o \\right\\}$ and efforts of practice. This phase of research on IO further deepened, and also further deepened studies on fighting methods {zhanfa} for IO. In 1992, the US Department of Defense issued DoD Directive {zhiling} 3600.1\u2014 Information Warfare {xinxizhan}, which began to study IO theory in key point based, phase-by-phase manner {you zhongdian, fenjieduan di}, and developed IW capabilities. The fiscal year 1995 US Defense Report carried out a delimiting {jieding} of IO, and the fiscal year 1996 Defense Report at fairly great length discussed IO issues. The US military\u2019s Joint Vision 2010 {2010 nian lianhe gouxiang} and its accompanying full set of {peitao} trans-century long-range plans $\\{ g u i h u a \\}$ for the various services and arms {junbingzhong} all at very great length discussed the importance and main content of IO. In 1993, DoD took the lead in carrying out structural adjustment {tiaozheng} of its directly subordinate institutions, and clarified the duties $\\{ z h i z e \\}$ of each department in terms of developing IO capabilities. In 1994, it established an Information Systems Security Center {xinxi xitong anquan zhongxin}, Joint Staff C2 Warfare Center {lianhe canmoubu zhihui kongzhizhan zhongxin}, and Joint Staff IO Bureau {lianhe canmoubu xinxi zuozhan ju}. The US Army, Navy, and Air Force respectively established the corresponding IO institutions, and issued the corresponding operational regulations {zuozhan tiaoling}.", "metadata": "2021-10-12 Lectures Joint Campaign Information Operations CASI_EN.md", "judgement": true}, "6": {"text": "The large language model analyzes a large amount of data through algorithms, identifies the cognitive habits and psychological weaknesses of specific groups or individuals, and then manipulates their cognition and behavior through customized information push. ? The \"Comprehensive Evaluation of the Credibility of the GPT Model\" report points out that the potential of the large language model to be weaponized and used in cognitive warfare lies in the fact that the content generated by the ChatGPT algorithm is a mixture of real information and false and forged information, which induces the user's attention and perceptual stimulation. \u2462 ChatGPT's generative algorithm strategy takes advantage of this human cognitive and psychological tendency, that is, when the information contains known and credible elements, the public is more likely to accept the authenticity of the entire information. This \"real and fake\" mixed strategy greatly increases the difficulty of distinguishing the authenticity of information, making false information easier to be believed. ? Generative AIs such as ChatGPT mix facts and non-factual information they generate to create biased, misleading, and agitational content to impact existing cognition, and have the initial offensive and defensive potential for psychological manipulation and cognitive deception. ChatGPT can disguise misleading content as seemingly credible and logically coherent content, and its confident tone further enhances its cognitive deception, increasing users' trust and acceptance of misleading or biased content. Compared with \"non-kinetic wars\" such as psychological warfare, information warfare, public opinion warfare, and cyber warfare, artificial intelligence cognitive warfare based on large language models has significant advantages in five aspects: concealment, efficiency, accuracy, flexibility, and destructiveness: 1. The concealment of AI cognitive warfare. Compared with physical warfare, AI cognitive warfare is more covert and difficult to defend. Large language models have greatly expanded the scope and depth of cognitive warfare, invisibly manipulating information flows to create seemingly natural false information or misleading opinions. Its concealment and extensiveness make it difficult for traditional information and cognitive defense strategies to work. The cognitive warfare content generated by large language models usually exaggerates facts, exaggerates panic, or creates hostility. It is difficult to be identified as false content under information disguise, and can quickly trigger public emotional resonance and chain reactions. Because the United States has the first-mover advantage of generative artificial intelligence, if it embeds the cognitive warfare content of large language models into its public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and information warfare against China, it will be able to take advantage of the United States' powerful \"water army\" scale advantage in automatically generating accounts and publishing content, and use large language models to... --- The algorithm recommendation mechanism embedded in the model and social platform and the penetration of social relationship chains realize active \"feeding\", large-scale interaction and forwarding. \"Therefore, the cognitive content generated in batches by large language models is embedded in the cognitive confrontation of psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and intelligence warfare as the \"raw materials\" of cognitive attack and defense. This potential scenario will pose a national security risk to China that cannot be ignored. The cognitive content generated by large language models is more interactive, covers a wider range, and is more likely to affect individual cognition. In the daily use of ChatGPT, users are very likely to be deeply intervened by the cognitive content of human-computer interaction and deep learning without knowing it, and eventually their accumulated cognitive pressure will overwhelm the existing cognitive structure of the brain. At the same time, the application of artificial intelligence technology has also made fake news and deep fake content more realistic and difficult to identify, strengthening the complexity and concealment of artificial intelligence cognitive warfare. # **Second, the efficiency of AI cognitive warfare** It is reflected in the cost-benefit efficiency advantage. Algorithmic cognitive warfare breaks through the geographical limitations of traditional warfare, transforming the form of warfare from regional, physical domain material conflicts to global, virtual domain warfare. The key advantage of algorithmic cognitive warfare is that it almost eliminates the direct risks of war. Algorithmic cognitive warfare greatly improves combat effectiveness with its high efficiency and low cost, and minimizes the direct risks in war. # **The third is the accuracy of AI cognitive warfare** Large language models and deep learning algorithms can analyze massive amounts of data and identify the psychological and behavioral patterns of target groups, thereby enabling more accurate information operations and psychological manipulation. Driven by large language models, AI cognitive attack and defense demonstrates the characteristics of precise perception, precise prediction, and precise calculation, achieving clarity of combat objectives and customization of content generation. Large language models accurately portray user personality and cognitive characteristics based on massive data sources and feedback content, and use algorithms to build a portrait of the target's value orientation and way of thinking and match cognitive attack and defense content, achieving highly customized and precise feeding of \"cognitive bombs\" and precise \"sniping\" of user behavior patterns, preferences, and opinion tendencies. # **Fourth, the flexibility and adaptability of AI cognitive warfare** ## **This is reflected in the iterative and self-reinforcing characteristics of AI models. The self-learning and optimization capabilities of AI models mean that they can continuously adjust their strategies to adapt to countermeasures. Through continuous selection, large language models can learn more effective propaganda methods to better manipulate the emotions of the target population and gradually undermine their ability to judge objective facts. The cognitive combat environment is changing rapidly, and the content generated by the model also needs to be continuously adjusted and optimized as the environment changes. First, supervised fine-tuning can guide the large language model to be more in line with actual combat needs when generating cognitive attack and defense content based on pre-designed training data and refined parameter adjustments.** Secondly, AI can define a set of reward models for evaluating the quality and deviation of model-generated content, and then use content feedback to guide the model to gradually improve the generation strategy and reward function, continuously iterate training, and gradually learn to generate content that better meets the needs of cognitive operations. For example, by changing word embeddings, by labeling and changing the understanding and generation methods of certain specific words or concepts in the model, the weight of word embeddings can be gradually adjusted to make the generated content gradually fit the needs of cognitive attack and defense. \u2460 # **Fifth, the destructiveness of AI cognitive warfare** The potential weaponization of cognition by the Big Language Model and its potential involvement in cognitive warfare significantly increase the destructiveness and lethality of information. The two-way embedding of algorithm-driven large language models and deepfake technology can not only be used to spread misleading information, shape and manipulate public opinion, but also deepen the rift between hostile parties and undermine their stability and mutual trust. The destructiveness of AI cognitive warfare far exceeds that of traditional propaganda warfare, public opinion warfare, and information warfare, and it achieves the goal of conducting large-scale and precise cognitive distortion operations without the need for human intervention. In particular, the continuously improved multimodal capabilities of large language models have greatly expanded the means of cognitive adversarial warfare, making it possible to use large language models to conduct saturation-based precise cognitive attacks on specific audiences and to use deep fake technology to interfere with enemy decision-making cognition. ChatGPT advances the intelligent level of false information production. It is based on the generation and recognition of multimodal data, images and videos, and can generate realistic false images and videos to commit fraud. ## **From a tactical point of view, once ChatGPT and other cognitive weapons are weaponized, the attacker can use its advantages of \"big data top ten models $+$ strong algorithms\" to achieve large-scale production and deployment of \"cognitive ammunition\", quickly saturate the opponent's information environment, form a powerful cognitive offensive and contain the opponent's cognitive thinking, and achieve comprehensive suppression of cognitive offensive and defensive situations. From a strategic point of view, artificial intelligence cognitive warfare focuses on attrition warfare and protracted warfare, destroying or interfering with enemy cognition based on artificial intelligence means such as large language models. Algorithmic cognitive warfare based on ChatGPT can invisibly weaken the enemy's fighting will and resistance in an extremely covert way. Algorithmic cognitive warfare uses the mode of attrition warfare and protracted warfare to maximize the impact on the opponent's cognitive stability without spending any military cost, and achieve the goal of \"defeating the enemy without fighting\".** # **3\\. Artificial Intelligence Cognitive Warfare: Text, Narrative, and Mobilization** Since large language models have the prospect of being \"generalized\" and \"weaponized\" on a large scale by countries with artificial intelligence technology advantages and used for external cognitive offense and defense, the \"weaponization\" process of artificial intelligence cognitive warfare has become an issue that needs to be analyzed. Specifically, artificial intelligence cognitive warfare includes three components: \"ammunition\", \"weapons\" and \"targets\". # **First** Information flows carried by text are the \"ammunition\" of AI cognitive warfare. First, ChatGPT is used to generate massive texts or information flows that exceed the target's cognitive processing ability or thinking comprehension ability, so as to achieve a state of content overload and information drowning. The cognitive warfare attacker creates excessive content and text that is difficult to distinguish between true and false based on the large language model, and uses the target group's cognitive confusion to induce them to lose their way in the massive text and information and fall into a cognitive trap. Secondly, once the target group falls into a state of cognitive confusion, the ChatGPT algorithm \"tailors\" an information cocoon for them, selectively emphasizing or amplifying certain information, while ignoring or distorting other information, causing the audience to have cognitive biases in their judgment of facts. After the manipulator creates an information cocoon, it will further solidify the audience's attitude, leading to cognitive bias and cognitive closure, and shaping a false \"cognitive environment.\" # **second** ## **Narrative is the \"weapon\" of AI cognitive warfare. Narrative is not only a tool for disseminating information, but also a core mechanism for organizing and interpreting information. Due to the limitations of human individual social cognition in processing information, manipulators can take advantage of people's \"cognitive loopholes\". \"Weaponized narrative\" plays a key role in AI algorithm cognitive warfare, and acts as a \"narrative bomb\" in the process of cognitive formation or change through narrative manipulation. Large language models have the ability to process massive amounts of data and generate targeted content. They influence the opponent's psychology and decision-making process by manipulating information flow and narrative methods, making them a powerful cognitive warfare tool. It can be seen that large language models can create and disseminate narratives that are highly targeted and contagious in a very short period of time, identify cognitive loopholes and emotional trends through precise algorithms, and generate narrative content that meets the expectations of specific target audiences, making AI cognitive warfare more effective in influencing the opponent's cognition and emotions.** The large language model can create and produce influential, infectious, and provocative event narratives. Third, mobilization is the \"target\" of AI cognitive warfare. The potential of AI in cognitive warfare is reflected in its ability to guide cognition and conduct propaganda and mobilization. The emotional expression of cognitive domain warfare generated by the large language model is manifested as explicit expression or implicit pre-embedding, deeply rooted in clear opinions and attitudes or vague cognitive positions, obtaining the other party's emotional recognition and empathy, and achieving emotional mobilization. ChatGPT generates false content and puts users in a high cognitive pressure environment where text and content are repeatedly exposed and repeatedly stimulated. The cognitive threshold and cost of users accepting false content will continue to decrease, and ultimately \"reversing black and white\" will be achieved. Users are continuously induced and manipulated in a high cognitive pressure environment, gradually accepting and trusting false texts and information, and their vigilance and critical thinking ability decrease. # **Therefore, the two hypotheses to be tested in this study can be expressed as:** # **Hypothesis 1: \u201cConfusing right and wrong\u201d** Artificial intelligence large language models are able to \"confuse right and wrong\" and shape cognition and thinking patterns by selectively presenting information and falsifying facts, thus having the potential for algorithmic cognitive warfare. Artificial intelligence technology has significantly enhanced the attacker's ability to launch cognitive attacks in cognitive warfare. The large language model widely mobilizes public opinion and forces, driving negative emotions such as suspicion, panic and anxiety to continue to ferment within the opponent, inducing the opponent's internal instability or even collapse, and ultimately gaining an overwhelming cognitive offensive advantage. ?Conflict in the cognitive domain aims to strategically exploit these competing functions and cognitive biases that limit the rationality of different actors in order to cause distortions in thinking and emotional representations and thus change decisions. The attacker conducts large-scale sentiment analysis and pattern recognition based on the model, which greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of the attacker in actively shaping the other party's information, psychology, emotions, thinking and other cognitive domain components. ?", "metadata": "CHN_Cognitive_Weaponization_Cognitive_Warfare_Artificial_Intelligence_University_International_Relations_Sep2024-2_llama-parse_en.md", "judgement": true}, "7": {"text": "They have accurately assessed the major opponents and directions of threat to our national security at each time so that we have been able to resolutely defend our national unification and territorial integrity and protect the modernization of our national defense, security and socialism under very complicated and difficult conditions. In the mid-1950s, as foreign forces led by the US strategically encircled us so severely that they could attack us, the Party Central and the Central Military Committee (CMC) knowing this situation, decided to make the southeast coast area as our principal strategic direction. Between the 1960s and 1970s, as the Sino-Soviet relations broke up and the USSR stationed a large army along the Chinese border to deter us more seriously, the leadership resolutely moved the principal direction to the three northern regions. In the 1980s, according to the new international situation, they changed the principal strategic direction again. Through timely adjustments, we have always kept our strategically active position. Section Two:  Striving to Accomplish Goals of Strategic Actions While Paying a \t\t\tSmall Price Goals of strategic actions are the direct political fruits that war wants to reap. They are specifications of strategic goals as well as the starting and ending points of a series of strategic planning and management including setting strategic guiding principles, drafting strategic plans, confirming strategic missions, deciding strategic deployments, selecting strategic means and organizing strategic support. Thus, deciding on the goals of strategic actions is an important principle concerning the whole situation. Deciding goals of strategic actions is an essential substance of setting military strategy. Clausewitz once pointed out: \u201cStrategy is the application of combat for fulfilling goals of war. Thus, we must set goals that are adaptable to the objectives of war for the whole military actions.\u201d Goals of strategic actions are the indispensable contents for planning and directing the whole situation of military strategy. They can be divided into general goals and specific goals. The former controls the entire process of the strategic situation and is the direct manifestation of political ends in military actions. The latter is the political end that each strategic stage seeks, each strategic strength and each fighting means must be separately accomplished and the decomposition and thinning of general goals for horizontal connection in stages of time and other aspects. Only having set the general goals can we make an overall plan and deploy the whole military situation as well as solve a series of important strategic problems including war preparation, military building and strategic guiding principles effectively. Meanwhile, only by setting specific goals can we base our general strategic attempt at dividing the steps and directions necessary to achieve strategic actions and enhance the objectives and plans of war to ensure that goals are fulfilled. For example, in the initial period of the War of Liberation, based on the general goals of \u201cstriking down Chiang Kai-shek and liberating the entire China,\u201d Mao Zedong had decided the general goal for the PLA was to eliminate 100 brigades of the KMT troops in five years. He then set a specific, concrete number to be annihilated annually for each theater. These goals had changed the ratio of strength between the PLA and the KMT forces and become the key to accomplishing the objective of war. Setting goals of strategic actions is the prerequisite condition for selecting strategic means. The aim of military strategy is to combine and unify strategic aims and means. Goals of strategic actions are the precondition for choosing strategic means; strategic means is the practical measure of achieving strategic goals. They are closely related, and both must be present. Goals of strategic actions are the direction and standard for choosing strategic means. Different goals need different means, or the same goal can choose different means. The key is that the two must be properly planned and managed. With clear-cut goals of strategic actions, the strategic director can change the use of them according to military situations, correctly calculate the problems of how to develop and apply military forces to avoid a divorce between them. Based on the need of the goals of strategic actions, he can improve targeting at the application, flexibility and adaptability of strategic means and accurately employ the methods of actual fighting and deterrence to form mobile and flexible strategy and tactics. In short, only being under the guidance of correct goals of strategic actions can the application of strategic means meet the requirement of political and military struggles. This will bring the efficacy of all kinds of strategic actions into full play to form a whole operational might and render a better service to the fulfillment of political objectives. Setting goals of strategic actions usually should meet the following requirements: First, the goals must be in keeping with the basic national interest. They are a specific manifestation of general national policy and objectives in the military field. Their setting must take the principle of maintaining and defending the national interest. In terms of politics, the most important goal is political independence, sovereignty integrity and national unification, which are the most fundamental requirements. In terms of security, it is protecting territorial integrity and ocean rights to prevent them from foreign  encroachment, which is the most fundamental requirement to guarantee the fulfillment of other national interests. In terms of economy, it must provide the most powerful insurance for the safety of national economic construction. It should fully consider and embody the needs of national interests and be subordinate to and serve the objectives of the nation\u2019s political struggle in a certain period of time, which we must strive to accomplish even though there are difficulties and dangers. On the contrary, we should not act rashly in violation of national interest even though the goals can benefit us militarily. As a socialist nation observing an independent and autonomous foreign policy, the goals of strategic actions must uphold anti-aggression and anti-hegemony and protect world peace and national security. After the Cold War, although the environment for peripheral security has been relatively improved and massive armed invasion endangering China\u2019s survival could be avoided, hegemony and power politics, however, still exist and are developing. Foreign and domestic hostile powers are ganging up with each other to be crazily engaged in splitting  China. The historically inherited disputes over border areas and ocean rights are not yet totally settled and the threat of war is not completely eliminated; thus, goals of military strategic actions in the new era must fully consider the above situations and thoroughly satisfy the requirement of China\u2019s basic interests. Second, the goals must adapt to international situations. Correctly selecting goals of strategic actions has the aim of solving the security problem that China is facing at    certain times. Having an accurate understanding of the international situation is to macroscopically grasp major contradictions and the tendency of development of the world. The world strategic situation is a concentrated embodiment of the growth and decline as well as diversification and composition of comprehensive national strength of various countries. Its formation decides those countries\u2019 function and position in the international society. The powerful countries\u2019 tendency of aggression essentially reflects the nature and demand of their economic and political interests, which is an important factor to understand the relations of those countries, especially between great powers, and to correctly assess the whole situation. The tendency of war in the current world situation is a big issue affecting world security and to find out the kinetic reason for war is the basic way to analyze the threat of war. Development and change of the situation of peripheral security is an essential condition directly affecting national interests and a side view reflects the core problems among our neighboring countries, such as the contradiction of interests, strategic attempts and military movements. Thus, only by correctly understanding the international situation can we go along with the tide of history to catch the major conflict of interest among the deterring countries and correctly select our principal strategic direction. We can be clearer and more specific about the goals of military strategy and also be more practical in our targeting. Third, the goals must be beneficial to accomplishing our strategic objectives. Accomplishment of strategic goals is an important symbol of fulfilling military strategic objectives. As a form of specific manifestation of strategic objectives, strategic goals must appropriately and clearly embody all indexes of the objectives to make them not only practical and feasible but also satisfy strategic needs. We cannot set the goals too high to exceed the normal requirements of national interest and the actual capability of military forces and cause them to divorce themselves from strategic needs and move toward the opposite direction. Nor can we set them too low to make strategic objectives unable to be fulfilled on time and bring losses to our national interest. Therefore, when setting the goals, we must make them clear and specific and highly feasible in order to facilitate the grasping and conducting of them in military actions and ensure a smooth materialization of strategic objectives. Fourth, the goals must be compatible with strategic combat capability. Armed forces\u2018 strategic combat capability is a fundamental condition to materializing the goals of strategic actions. Strategic goals cannot be divorced from reality and raise missions that strategic combat capability cannot accomplish. Nor can we set the goals too high to abuse the means of strategic combat, and even set them too low to affect the materialization of strategic objectives. The mistakes of military adventurism and military conservatism have given China\u2019s revolutionary war unfavorable lessons or even failures; therefore, in order to keep strategic goals in line with the reality of strategic combat capability, we must \u201cdo what we can..\u201d It means that we must base the reality of strategic combat capability on set strategic goals and select means for strategic combat according to our needs. We must strive to heighten the level of strategic combat to make it adaptable to the need and to closely combine the application and building of military forces to lay a material foundation for the fulfillment of strategic goals. Fifth, we must attain the biggest victory with the smallest price. On the selection of goals of strategic actions, we should foster the concept of military effectiveness and results. We should never pay a huge sacrifice and price for a limited victory and advantage; instead, we should minimize the cost and sacrifice and strive to realize our strategic goals with the lowest price as it is an important display of the strategic director\u2019s superb art of command. For this reason, under modern conditions, when setting strategic goals, we must base our plans on the characteristics of modern high-tech warfare to select vulnerabilities in the enemy\u2019s operational system and strike them hard. We must try to go for the favorable and avoid the harmful and proceed to the real and bypass the false and use one soldier as ten. Unless the nation is in danger of life or death, we should never fight a decisive war at any cost. Under normal conditions, we should not fight to overcome the enemy if we can do it without fighting or not fight a large battle if a small battle can serve the purpose. We must strive to use a small battle or create a momentum to cause a strong psychological shock to the enemy to achieve the consequences of \u201csubduing the enemy without fighting\u201d or \u201csubduing the enemy by a small battle.\u201c Section Three: Never Fighting a Battle Unprepared or Unsure of Winning War is a big fundamental matter affecting the life and death, honor and shame and gain and loss of a country, a nation or a political group; thus, we must insist on the principle of being careful with war and conducting it with extra caution. When facing the threat of war or military pressure, the strategic director must calmly analyze the situation and weigh the pros and cons to carefully make strategic selections. He must not despise combat and rush to conclusions nor be timid and indecisive. He must strive to closely plan and be fully prepared and strive to win the war when the situation is more in our favor. I. Closely planning and being fully prepared War is full of unpredictable \u201ctraps\u201d and \u201cmist\u201d and is more unpredictable and less certain than other societal elements. Never fight a battle unprepared or unsure of winning,  requires close planning and fully being prepared before any military actions. In the ancient Chinese book of war, the teachings of \u201ccalculating in the temple,\u201d \u201cthe way of using forces is to plan first and then take action,\u201d \u201cto fight an enemy and win a war should have a plan first.\u201d  \u201cThe enemy is always defeated when beating it with a plan.\u201d  All emphasized the importance of close planning and being fully prepared. Clausewitz, the famous Prussian military theorist, believed planning operations and demands allowed each common action to achieve this sort of unification. Napoleon thought that everything would end in nothing if not planned beforehand. In the long practice of China\u2019s revolutionary war, Mao Zedong used the viewpoint of material dialectics to profoundly analyze the probabilities and uncertainties in wars and pointed out \u201cdue to the uncertainties in wars, to carry out planning in wars is more difficult than applying it in other undertakings. However, things stand when planned and fall apart when not. We cannot win victory in a war without previous planning and preparations.\u201d  He summarized a series of logic of military knowledge and strategic guidance, from reconnaissance, assessment to planning and preparation, thereby achieving a maximum unification of the probabilities and uncertainties in wars and military struggles and successfully solving the contradiction in the planning nature of subjective guidance and the probability in objective reality. II. Being sure of both subjective and objective conditions Being planned and prepared is the precondition of attaining victory, but it does not mean that we are sure of winning. As Mao Zedong said, \u201cWe do not fight a battle unprepared and unsure of winning, and we can fight a battle prepared but unsure of winning.\u201c  In order to fight a battle sure of winning, on the one hand, we must positively prepare all material conditions for defeating the enemy.", "metadata": "Science of Strategy 2001 (English).docx", "judgement": true}, "8": {"text": "Volume 18 Issue 7 July 2016 Ideological & Political WorkIdeological&PoliticalWork Journal of MilitaryTransportation University Vol.18No.7 July 2016 Analysis on the Psychological Elements of Decision Makers in Our Own Country Zhao Juan Department of Military Psychology, Armed Police Political College, Shanghai 200435) Abstract: In order to promote the development of my country's target strategic coercion and ensure the realization of national security strategy and national interests, this paper analyzes in detail the cognition and belief, emotion and emotion, needs and motivation, personality and style of decision makers in the target country of strategic coercion.

In fact, the decision-making process often begins with the attention and perception of a situation of strategic intimidation. In the opinion of political scientists, the perception of the threat of the undermining party by policymakers in the target country is important. If policymakers see another country as a threat, they can 74 It is often assumed that the other party has both strength and intent to hinder the achievement of its goals or endanger its national security. Memory often provides decision-makers with some information related to their decision-making, or decision-makers must use their memory of others and the impressions of others formed on the basis of this memory to explain the policy of the arrogant party. For example, the U.S. designation of certain countries as evil is rooted in those politicians' memories of the early actions of their leaders. Belief systems are more directly linked to decision-makers' decision-making behavior. Ollie Holsty points out that policymakers act on analysis of the situation and perceptions of other countries, which in turn depend on their belief systems. The knowledge of reality is part of the belief system, and the decision-making and behavior of decision-makers depend in part on the knowledge of reality. For example, in one crisis, the intimidating party ostensibly deployed an armoured corps in an attempt to force the target country to accept its demands, and the target country's decision makers assessed the possibility of war and decided whether to back down. However, assuming that the target country's decision makers learn that the tanks are old and do not have sufficient fuel and supplies to actually take military action, the decision makers will correct their beliefs and the final decision may be very different. Cognition and belief can not only guide decision makers to correctly understand the status quo, and rationally determine whether to challenge the intimidating party, but also induce them to develop cognitive biases through habitual and simplified paths, resulting in the failure of intimidation. Taking predisposition as an example, although the vast majority of correct inferences are also strongly influenced by predisposition, it is often paranoid and aspirational, causing decision makers to reject unfavorable evidence and only look at what they expect to see. to the result. For example, in the past 2015, the world was deeply troubled by security. Traditional security issues and non-traditional security issues intertwined. Conflicts and disasters emerged one after another. Then, fighting terrorism is the primary aspiration of many countries. Once there is trouble, the first thing governments consider is a terrorist attack, and quickly make a response plan. People generally see attacks on terrorists, but rarely see other adverse factors, such as people's helplessness and political factors. Another example is the incident of Turkey's downing of a Russian military plane. People must first think of Russia's military retaliation against Turkey, and eagerly expect it to happen, but the result is a series of sanctions and Braille attacks. The sentiment and Moreover, the decision-making of the decision-makers of the standard country under the strategic coercion is often full of Volume 18 Issue 7 Journal of Military Transportation Academy Look at strong negative emotions and emotions, which are related to their methods of challenging their demands and intimidating them. The target country often initiates challenges based on dissatisfaction with the status quo, and the strategic coercion, which is mainly based on threats and force, shows the determination of the intimidating country to completely veto the challenger\u2019s intention to challenge. In this way, hatred, hostility, hatred, fear, despair, and anxiety and tension induced by crisis situations based on obstructed interests and desires run through the decision-making process of the decision-makers in the benchmark country. Fear is the most important emotional issue for decision makers in the target country, and it stems from the perception of one's own vulnerability to attack by other countries, which is almost universal in international politics. Fear, hostility, and military readiness of one adversary prompt the same response in the other, resulting in an escalating spiral of arms races between them, known as the \"fear dilemma.\" Simply put, the fear dilemma is that the actions of one country's policy makers to eliminate fear will inevitably increase the fear of other countries' policy makers. In fact, whether it is the theoretical concept of more than 2,000 years since Thucydides, or historical examples such as the origin of the Peloponnesian War and the US-Soviet Cold War, all show the \"fear dilemma\", the \"psychodynamics of conflict escalation\" \" is a major constant motivation in international relations1]. Howard believes that part of the cause of World War I was the increase in German power and the resulting fear of Britain. In order to ease Tokyo's policy during World War II, the United States and Western European countries first froze Japanese property and then imposed an oil embargo on Japan. The result has sparked fears among Japanese leaders that it will deprive them of the means to continue their rivalry with China and ultimately lead to the loss of any advantage. \"Correspondingly, it created a sense of despair in Tokyo, which was a basic prerequisite for the subsequent attack on Pearl Harbor.\" The terror threat in 2015, which engulfed most of the population in a sense of fear, led to a large influx of refugees. people Europe. According to the European Commission forecast, by the end of 2016, the total number of refugees entering Europe will reach 3 million. This has laid a legal foundation for countries to send troops into Syria to fight terrorist organizations. To this end, French President Francois Hollande stressed that the fight against terrorism \"is not over yet\"; European countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy and other European countries have declared war on terrorism; Nigeria and Cameroon have pledged to \"do whatever it takes\" to combat \"Boko Haram extremist groups, etc.\" It is also fear, but the fear caused by the ultimate weapon can greatly inhibit the desire of decision-makers to challenge. Khrushchev once said that (in a nuclear war) the living will be jealous of the dead. Because no one can predict that once a nuclear war starts, The destruction effect caused by the world, so the Soviet and American policymakers had to restrain their own behavior while being vigilant about the opponent's direction. Kenneth Waltz pointed out that during the Cold War, the \"fear of the whole beast sacrifice\" between the United States and the Soviet Union for the nuclear war was in the previous countries. July 2016 never appeared in the relationship. Today's threat of nuclear war has changed, but panic still plays a restraining role. The threat and counter-threat situation caused by strategic coercion can easily induce the nervousness of the decision makers of the target country. Under great pressure and high tension, decision makers' cognition may be completely different from usual, and even policy and behavior patterns may change, such as increased random behaviors, increased error rate, moving toward simpler and primitive response patterns, and adopting forceful responses. Problem solving, distraction, and reduced tolerance for ambiguity, among others. Holsty confirms that threatening tactics can significantly \"increase the tension that forces the other side to take action,\" which in turn increases the urgency of time and the danger of policymakers relying on those single, familiar options , regardless of whether these solutions are effective solutions to current problems. Research on World War I, the Korean War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis demonstrates that as tensions rise during crises, interactions between target country policymakers and intimidating parties diminish and become more stylized. At present, both the United States and Russia are developing and deploying strategic missile hypersonic glide warheads, which can theoretically break through any existing air defense system. In terms of developing new conventional means of strategic coercion, the United States, Russia and other countries are competing to develop conventional strategic containment capabilities centered on large-scale \"global rapid strike\" capabilities. On the basis of the establishment of the Global Strike Command in 2009, the U.S. military formulated a vision of \"global rapid strike\" before 2030, and developed a hypersonic cruise aircraft based on the SR-51A, which will integrate technology with aerospace aircraft to form an aerospace integration. The hypersonic aviation-spaceflight general-purpose platform will be used as our platform to upgrade the \"global rapid strike\" system to the \"global instant strike\" system, which poses a huge challenge to the existing nuclear weapons-based strategic containment system, which also forms tension between the two sides. pressure chain. The needs and The needs and motivations of policy makers in target countries have been widely recognized as important variables that lead to the failure of coercion. John Vasquez concluded that, at the individual level, conflicts erupted from the strong security needs and frustration motives of decision makers. Dignity-related \"face\" is an important class of needs and behavioral motives that compel decision-makers to take action. U.S. President Kennedy found that policymakers are often forced to respond to the actions of the other party for \u201cface\u201d reasons, which in turn will lead to a response from the other party, which ultimately leads to an escalation of armed conflict. .1] Karen Horney believes that those \"fanatical pursuit of honor\" decisions Juan: Analysis of the Psychological Elements of Decision Makers in Strategically Powerful Target Countries 175 Those who choose to do it in the form of external challenges.

The needs and motivations described above all seriously affect the stability of strategic authority. Often, overpowering needs and motives can easily induce a motive bias that can lead to a failure of coercion. Motivational biases are mostly produced in three ways. First, policymakers in target countries feel the need to address pressing domestic threats, including resolving internal conflicts, securing the ruling position of policymakers and their parties, and even protecting sectoral interests. Due to the difficult situation in the country, on the one hand, policy makers begin to believe that these threats can only be solved by challenging the intimidating party and changing the status quo.

This report examines the concept\u2019s history, current consensus, and enduring debates about what it entails. It also proposes a model of strategic culture as a complex system. What is strategic culture? After a review of relevant literature, we propose the following definition: An actor\u2019s1 strategic culture is composed of beliefs, experiences, assumptions, attitudes, and patterned behaviors that shape perceptions and preferences about its security-related interests, objectives, and activities. This definition reflects the consensus of most scholars. However, key issues remain concerning the relationship of strategic behavior to strategic culture, the social and political levels at which it operates, and how strategic culture can be modeled. Strategic behavior and strategic culture. Many scholars assert a recursive relationship between strategic culture and strategic behavior. Culture can impact behaviors, and behaviors sometimes reinforce elements of culture. However, if the concept of strategic culture is to be useful for national security analysis, it must predict some amount of an organization\u2019s strategic behavior. Including all strategic behaviors (e.g., nuclear postures, military investments, deployments, military conduct in war, operations under the level of armed conflict) in the definition of strategic culture potentially creates a tautology that undermines prediction. To avoid this tautology, only traditional, repeated, and patterned behaviors are included in our definition of strategic culture, allowing other elements of strategic behavior to emerge independently. Whether or not strategic culture influences strategic behavior remains an open question. Furthermore, there is consensus among scholars that factors, such as pragmatic material concerns, influence strategic behaviors and may override the effect of strategic culture all together. The influence of strategic culture on strategic behavior should be considered an empirical question to be tested in specific applications. Whose strategic culture matters? Strategic cultures exist at the international, national, and subnational levels, like political parties, popular opinion, intelligentsia, and powerful stakeholders. Any analysis of an actor\u2019s strategic behavior must identify which stakeholders and their associated strategic cultures actually influence it. Strategic culture as a complex system. Scholars have proposed that strategic culture is composed of identity, values, perceptions, and patterned behaviors. However, these elements are not independent; they can influence each other, creating a complex system of interrelationships. The complex system model we propose allows for the adaptation of the strategic culture concept to different nations and contexts. Background The 21st century operational environment challenges Western 20th century strategic concepts. The 21st century began with a US focus on asymmetric threats from non-state actors who held incompatibly different views, values, and motivations from the West. Meanwhile, adversarial states retooled their strategic approaches to compete with, and potentially undermine, Western power and the rules-based order by competing below the level of open armed conflict. The need to understand the motives, interests, and potential actions of these culturally different state and non-state actors led to renewed interest in the role that an actor\u2019s culture plays in its strategic behavior, and by extension, efforts to deter it. The concept that an actor\u2019s strategic culture2 influences its strategic behavior is both intuitive and ancient. It implies that different actors approach competition and conflict with different cultural lenses, assumptions, and perhaps behaviors.3 An early nod to strategic culture was proposed by the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu 2,500 years ago in his directive that \u201cone who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be endangered in a hundred engagements\u201d (Sun Tzu, 1963, p. 84). The ancient Greek historian Thucydides attributed the Athenians\u2019 power to their cultural and psychological attributes of innovation and restlessness (Thucydides, 1954, pp. 75-76). In The Conquest of Gaul, written around 50 BCE, Julius Caesar provided descriptions of Germanic culture and how he thought it inclined them for war. Centuries later, Clausewitz (1943, p. 125) stressed moral qualities, an element of culture, as a key dimension of war. An overview of strategic culture-like concepts in historical perspective is presented in... Prior to World War II, anthropologists of the culture and personality school of thought proposed that the way a people are socialized in a particular culture leads to the development of modal personality types that, in turn, give each culture a distinct character (Benedict, 1959). The leaders of this school of thought, Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict, used this approach during WWII in national character studies intended to provide insight into US, Japanese, and Soviet ways of war (Al-Rodhan, 2015; Benedict, 1946; Hinton, 2020; Mead, 1942). Thinking about the relationship of culture to strategy continued to be influenced by anthropologists after WWII. Nathan Leites (1951) credited Margaret Mead with influencing his notion of an operational code.4 The next major work on culture and strategy was Jack Snyder\u2019s landmark 1977 study of Soviet strategic decision-making in which he coined the term strategic culture. He defined it as: The sum total of ideas, conditioned emotional responses, and patterns of habitual behavior that members of a national strategic community have acquired through instruction or imitation and share with each other with regard to [nuclear] strategy (Snyder, 1977, p. 8). Snyder\u2019s work motivated academic scrutiny of the concept, resulting in several \u201cgenerations\u201d or schools of thought regarding what strategic culture is, whose strategic culture matters, and, most important, what (if any) effect strategic culture has on an actor\u2019s strategic behavior.5 This report will address these fundamental questions and propose a model of strategic culture along with illustrations of Russian and Chinese strategic culture. Strategic Culture\u2014The Debates Important epistemological, theoretical, and empirical issues about the definition and usefulness of \u201cstrategic culture\u201d remain unresolved. Nevertheless, assertions about the importance of the concept have persisted. In 2005, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) funded a workshop that involved about two dozen strategic culture researchers in an effort to resolve debates in the field, develop a methodology for systematic application of strategic culture to national security issues, apply that methodology, and provide a curriculum for teaching comparative strategic culture (Larsen, 2006). The DTRA workshop participants came to agreement on a number of crucial issues (Johnson, 2006). They agreed that strategic culture changes, although more slowly than other political influences, and therefore has the potential for long-term influences on strategic behaviors that typically occur on shorter timescales. Furthermore, all agreed that a state\u2019s strategic culture is only one among many factors that influence its strategic behavior. Pragmatic concerns, such as military might and alliances, also influence strategic behavior and may very well supersede any influence strategic culture may have on specific actions. The participants also agreed that in any nation, multiple sub-national groups and organizations are stakeholders who can have differing strategic cultures and that any complete analysis of a nation\u2019s strategic behavior must consider what these are, their interactions, and their influences on strategic behavior. As to whether strategic culture causes behavior, the contributors differed. Some, such as Colin Gray (1999, 2006), maintained that the concept is primarily useful for providing a context for understanding behavior. Others, such as Christopher Twomey (2006), remained skeptical that strategic culture could explain behavior. However, all contributors agreed that strategic cultures exist, can be systematically identified, and are important when contemplating strategic behavior.\nThe DTRA study produced a conceptual model of strategic culture based on four key variables: national identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens. Furthermore, the study authors proposed that these variables can be measured by dozens of inputs, such as sacred texts, historical political systems, interactions with other nations, demographics, and global norms. Their model is elaborated further below (see Strategic Culture as a Complex System: A Model). They applied their model to analyze US, Russian, Chinese, Israeli, Indian, Pakistani, Iranian, Syrian, and al Qaeda strategic cultures in an effort to demonstrate its usefulness (Larsen, 2006). Interest in strategic culture has continued (Adamsky, 2020; Antczak, 2018; Gotz & Staun, 2022; Hassner, 2014, 2016; Herd, 2022; Hinton, 2020; Johnson, 2021; Libel, 2020; Pillsbury, 2015; Rumer & Sokolsky, 2020; Scobell, 2014; Simalcik, 2020; Sinovets, 2016; Tellis, 2016; Zarobny & Salek-Iminska, 2021). Bloomfield (2012, p. 456) attempted to unite competing views of strategic culture and concluded that \u201cfrom Gray we take the notion that culture provides context; that it guides and shapes interpretation: we just have to accept that culture is a disaggregated thing with contradictory elements rather than a monolithic whole. From Johnston, we take the goal of building falsifiable theory.\u201d However, not all scholars find value in the concept; Echevarria (2013) concluded that strategic culture is a concept with \u201cmore problems than prospects\u201d that should be abandoned. Strategic Culture in US Deterrence Concepts Finally, it should be noted that the concept of strategic culture is both implicit and featured in important US national security documents. The concept of tailored deterrence introduced in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) directed that US deterrence strategies and operations should be tailored to different types of adversaries, such as nuclear states, non-nuclear state adversaries, and non-state terrorist organizations, and should include the different kinds of forces and military capabilities emergent in the 21st century (U.S. Department of Defense, 2006). The 2006 QDR also stressed the need for understanding the cultures of adversaries and populations among whom warfighters operated. Elaine Bunn (2007, p. 3) pointed out that by invoking the need to tailor deterrence to other types of actors, tailored deterrence implied a need for understanding the strategic cultures of adversaries, and to be feasible, it must address questions, such as, \u201cWhat are the nation\u2019s or group\u2019s values and priorities? How are these affected by its history and strategic culture?\u201d She also emphasized the need for communications to adversaries to be tailored to adversaries\u2019 perceptions, which are shaped by \u201can adversary\u2019s national and cultural attributes as well as its unique history of dealing with and studying the United States (Bunn, 2007, p. 7).\u201d6 The 2022 National Security Strategy (NSS) introduced the concept of integrated deterrence (White House, 2022, p. 22). The 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) considers integrated deterrence to be its \u201ccenterpiece,\u201d while noting that it should be \u201ctailored to specific competitors and challenges\u201d (U.S. Department of Defense, 2022, p. iv). The inclusion of tailored deterrence and its implicit mandate to consider culture logically connects strategic culture to the new integrated deterrence concept. Strategic Culture\u2014What Is It? What are the main components of \u201cstrategic culture\u201d? We reviewed 22 published definitions and identified specific elements encompassing ideological, affective (i.e., emotional), cognitive, experiential, and behavioral factors. We propose the following based on our review of the 22 definitions in Table 1:", "metadata": "2023-08-29_Kuznar-Strategic-Culture_final3_2-cl.txt", "judgement": true}, "10": {"text": "Secrecy & Stratagem: Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture Thomas G.

Drawing on ancient texts, modern official documents and accounts of Beijing\u2019s decision-making during crises, Secrecy & Stratagem raises important questions about the potentially risky relationship between Chinese strategic culture, misperception and miscalculation in Asia\u2019s uncertain security future. Secrecy and Stratagem: Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture Thomas G. Mahnken February 2011 Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture Contents Introduction Defining Strategic Culture National Strategic Culture Military Strategic Culture Topics for Further Study Notes References Secrecy and Stratagem 1. Introduction It appears that the United States is in a military competition with China that, for planning purposes, can be assumed to go on for the foreseeable future. As the 2008 National Defense Strategy states, \u201cThe Department will respond to China\u2019s expanding military power, and to the uncertainties over how it might be used, through shaping and hedging. This approach tailors investment of substantial, though not infinite, resources in ways that favor key enduring U.S. advantages. At the same time, we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to China if necessary.\u201d To have any hope of success, any strategy for dealing with China over the long term should be based upon an understanding both of the United States\u2019 enduring strengths and weaknesses and those of China. These features should flow from sources that are immutable, such as geography, or that change slowly and predictably, such as culture or demography. During the Cold War, the United States over time developed a good understanding of key features of Soviet strategic culture. These features, which included the imperative of defending the Russian Motherland (Rodina) from attack and a centralised style of command and control, served as the basis for strategy development and force modernisation. For example, recognition of the importance that the Soviet government placed on defending the Motherland, manifested in the existence of national air defence forces (Protivovozdushnoi Oborony Strany, or PVO Strany) as a separate service with high levels of investment in air defence, informed U.S. decisions to maintain a manned penetrating bomber force as well as develop new systems such as the B-2 stealth bomber. The United States currently lacks a similar appreciation of the main tenets of Chinese strategic culture. This paper presents an initial attempt to redress this gap. In particular, it seeks to understand the enduring features of Chinese strategic culture, develop indicators that could be used to validate whether these features are indeed operative and enduring, and explicate potential implications of these features for strategy development. It is based upon three types of evidence: (1) translations of both ancient Chinese texts on strategy, such as Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War, and a sampling of modern official documents, such as the Chinese defence white papers and The Science of Military Strategy; (2) analyses of Chinese strategic culture by American, French, and Chinese scholars; and (3) other evidence, such as accounts of Chinese crisis decision-making and patterns of military deployments. There are two compelling reasons to study Chinese strategic culture. First, it may give us insight into Chinese decision-making. Indeed, it may help us understand behaviour that on the face of it seems irrational. Moreover, certain features of strategic culture may promote misperception. For example, one would expect a state possessing a highly ethnocentric strategic culture to overestimate its capabilities relative to those of potential adversaries. A second reason to study Chinese strategic culture is that the Chinese themselves see it as an important determinant of their behaviour and that of others. Indeed, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) has published a book on the subject entitled Analysis of China\u2019s Strategic Culture, which explores Chinese strategic culture in depth and contrasts it with \u201cWestern\u201d strategic culture. In the words of Lieutenant General Li Jijun, the former Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, \u201cCulture is the root and foundation of strategy. Strategic thinking, in the process of its evolutionary history, flows into the mainstream of a country or a nation\u2019s strategic culture. Each country or nation\u2019s strategic culture cannot but bear the imprint of cultural traditions, which, in a subconscious and complex way, prescribes and defines strategy making.\u201d Similarly, the authors of the Chinese handbook The Science of Military Strategy argue that, \u201cStrategic thought is always formed on the basis of certain historical and national cultural tradition, and formulation and performance of strategy by strategists are always controlled and driven by certain cultural ideology and historical cultural complex.\u201d Most Chinese military leaders believe that ancient Chinese values and warfighting principles remain relevant today. Ancient Chinese philosophical texts, military treatises such as The Art of War and the Seven Military Classics of Ancient China, and literary classics such as Journey to the West and The Water Margin are central to the identity of the PLA. The PLA teaches that its members are heirs to an ancient Chinese legacy and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s revolutionary struggles. PLA military handbooks routinely refer to battles fought 4,000 years ago as object lessons, and PLA leaders seek guidance from 2,500-year-old writings for modern operations. Indeed, even today, Chinese officers freely distribute translations of the Chinese military classics to their hosts. Chinese strategists also view others as possessing their own unique strategic culture. For example, they contrast an expansionist, bellicose \u201cWestern\u201d way of war with what they see as their own pacifist tradition. Organisation of this paper Chapter 2 begins by defining the concept of strategic culture and discussing challenges to operationalising it. Chapter 3 describes the four tenets of China\u2019s national strategic culture: \u2022 China is culturally superior \u2022 China\u2019s natural position is that of the \u201cMiddle Kingdom\u201d \u2022 China must be unified internally and free from external meddling, and \u2022 war is costly, destructive, and leads to internal dissension. Chapter 4 describes the four tenets of China\u2019s military strategic culture: \u2022 safeguarding Chinese territorial integrity is an important military mission \u2022 the goal of strategy is to exploit the propensity of things, or shi, \u2022 to achieve one\u2019s objectives war is a scientific process, and through secrecy and stratagem, \u2022 it is possible to achieve a decisive victory against a superior adversary Chapter 5 contains recommendations for further research. Understanding Chinese Strategic Culture 2. Defining Strategic Culture The literature examining culture and its application to international affairs is rich. The sociologist Clifford Geertz, for example, defined culture as a \u201csystem of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes towards life.\u201d Similarly, Jack Snyder has termed culture \u201ca set of semi-permanent elite beliefs, attitudes, and behavior patterns socialized into a distinctive mode of thought.\u201d Definitions of strategic culture similarly vary somewhat. Andrew Scobell has defined it as \u201ca persistent system of values held in common by the leaders or group of leaders of a state concerning the use of military force.\u201d The Defense Threat Reduction Agency\u2019s Comparative Strategic Cultures project proposed that strategic cultures consist of \u201cshared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.\u201d This paper adopts Alastair Iain Johnston\u2019s definition of strategic culture as an integrated \u201csystem of symbols (e.g., argumentation structures, analogies, metaphors) which acts to establish pervasive and long-lasting strategic preferences by formulating concepts of the role and efficacy of military force in interstate political affairs, and by clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the strategic preferences seem uniquely realistic and efficacious.\u201d Or in other words, strategic culture consists of a limited, consistently ranked set of preferences that is persistent over time. Culture thus closely resembles the cognitive and motivational biases discussed in political science literature. The line between culture and cognitive processes is less distinct than was once thought. Recent research by Richard E. Nisbett and others challenges the long-held belief that cognitive processes are universal. To the contrary, Nisbett and his colleagues have provided some evidence that the considerable social differences that exist between cultures affect not only beliefs about specific aspects of the world but also the nature of cognitive processes. Social organization directs attention to certain aspects of reality at the expense of others. What people pay attention to, in turn, affects their beliefs about the functioning of the world and causality. For example, whereas Western civilisation is dominated by personal agency, Chinese culture emphasizes reciprocal social obligation and collective agency. The Chinese believe that people are part of a collective and that the behavior of the individual should be guided by group expectations. Nisbett\u2019s research shows that cultural traditions in general influence systems of thought, and that Asians in particular possess systems of thought that are highly influenced by their holistic cultural tradition. In a series of psychological experiments, Nisbett and Takahiko Masuda showed that Asians, more than Americans, explain events in their context. In separate research, Nisbett and Incheol Choi have shown that Asians, because of their holistic reasoning, take inconsistency for granted and are consequently less likely than Americans to experience surprise. Strategic cultures may share features. For example, just because a belief in the efficacy of deception is a feature of Chinese strategic culture, it does not follow that such a belief is uniquely Chinese. Other cultures, such as that of Persia (Iran), also put great weight on stratagem. Similarly, just because culture is influential, it is not necessarily determinative. As Alexander L. George wrote forty years ago, culture \u201cinfluences, but does not unilaterally determine, decision-making; it is an important, but not the only, variable that shapes decision-making behavior.\u201d Or, as the Chinese military authors Peng Guangqian and Yao Youzhi put it, \u201cCulture is not tantamount to behavior, nor is tradition to realities. However, cultural tradition, no doubt, may influence on choice of behavior in realities.\u201d Key to understanding strategic culture, therefore, is understanding just how much of an effect strategic culture has on behavior. Culture must, of course, be applied carefully. Not to do so \u201crisks replacing strategy with stereotypes,\u201d as Patrick Porter observed. One of the central challenges that the student of any nation\u2019s strategic culture faces is determining which institutions serve as the keeper and transmitter of strategic culture. Is it the state? The military as a whole? Or some subset of the military? Another challenge lies in identifying the content of strategic culture, the most salient beliefs and attitudes that make up culture. Last but not least is the challenge of determining the extent to which strategic culture, rather than power considerations, actually determines attitudes and behavior. One particular challenge in dealing with Chinese strategic culture involves disentangling how Chinese leaders portray themselves from how they act. As Andrew Scobell has noted, most Chinese elites believe that China possesses a uniquely pacifistic strategic culture, that China has never been an expansionist state, and that China has never fought an aggressive war in its history. The stereotypical view of China adopted by scholars in China, as well as in the West, is one of a state possessing a weak martial tradition and a cultural predisposition to seek non-violent solutions to problems of state. However, this self-image has not always influenced practice. As Warren I. Cohen has observed, \u201cIn the creation of their empire, the Chinese were no less arrogant, no less ruthless, than the Europeans, Japanese, or Americans in the creation of theirs.\u201d Rather, successive generations of Chinese scholars created a narrative that shows that foreign nations have long sought to deny China its sovereignty. At the military strategic level, this narrative argues that the PLA saved China from foreign aggression and domestic tyranny and prevented more powerful adversaries from interfering in Chinese affairs. The military narrative stresses that China has only fought when forced to do so, and has always fought in a defensive and moral fashion. It also highlights the fact that the PLA has won every war even when it faced more advanced adversaries. Alastair Iain Johnston\u2019s careful work on the Ming period (1368\u20131644) concluded, however, that no pacifist bias appeared in the Chinese strategic tradition. By contrast, China\u2019s leaders operated according to the dictates of Realpolitik even if they often cloaked their actions in Confucian rationalizations.", "metadata": "Mahnken - Secrecy & Stratagem-cl.docx", "judgement": true}, "11": {"text": "Seizing information dominance is the core of seizing the initiative {zhudongquan} in blockade operations. They should establish a land, sea, air, and space integrated $\\{ y i t i \\}$ IO reconnaissance distribution system, to rigorously surveil and accurately grasp the situation of the enemy\u2019s IO force-strengths and weapons and its EM activity $\\{ h u o d o n g \\}$ , so as to provide a foundation for IO command decision-making {zhihui juece} and operational activities. They should concentrate use of the campaign\u2019s directly subordinate electronic offensive [attack] {dianzi jingong} strengths as well as those of the various services and arms, and under coordination with and complementation by other operational strengths, conduct key point jamming and suppression and destruction or sabotage of the vital site targets in the enemy\u2019s counter-blockade operational information system. [They should] at the right time apply network attack strengths to execute attacks on the network systems of the enemy\u2019s operational SoS, and to seize battlefield local information dominance, so as to create favorable conditions for the blockade operational activities. When seizing air dominance/supremacy, they should take the air information attack strengths as primary, and synthetically apply multiple information attack strengths, for key point jamming and suppressing and destroying or sabotaging of enemy early warning and detection systems, air defense and anti-missile command communication {fangkong fandao zhihui tongxin} systems, air defense weapons control systems, and information attack {xinxi gongji} systems which constitute threats to our air blockade operational activities, so as to assist-support and complement our operational activities to seize air dominance/supremacy. When seizing sea dominance, they should synthetically apply multiple information attack means, by air, sea, and land, for key point jamming, destruction, or sabotage of the enemy surface warning and detection {duihai jingjie tance} systems, command communication systems, air defense weapons control systems, and information attack systems which constitute threats to our sea blockade operations, so as to assistsupport and complement our operational activities to seize sea dominance.

[They should] synthetically apply information attack strengths, for key point jamming, destruction, or sabotage of the enemy\u2019s command communication systems, weapons control systems, and information attack systems, so as to degrade the enemy counter-preemption operational capability. For important targets, [they should] adopt [end of page 286] means such as electronic protection and concealment and camouflage, and coordinate with other operational strengths to safeguard $\\{ b a o w e i \\}$ the security of the important targets. In the phase for seizing blockade operational-area dominance, they should fully exploit means such as various types of propaganda and PSYWAR weapons, to execute psychological attacks against the enemy, so as to complement the operational activities of the other information attack strengths; and for important information targets, [they should] adopt information defense measures, to ensure our operational INFOSEC and the bringing into play of the information systems\u2019 effectiveness. # III. IO activities in the sustained blockade phase\u2026287 The JCC and his command organ should base themselves on protracted operations {chijiu zuozhan}, and uninterruptedly organize and command the IO strengths, while conducting continuous R&S of the enemy\u2019s important information system targets, in concentrating use of information attack strengths to conduct jamming and suppression and destruction or sabotage against those targets, so as to assist-support and complement the sustained blockade by the Navy, Air Force, and Second Artillery Corps against the enemy\u2019s air and sea lines of communication [SLOC] {haishang jiaotongxian}, and their sustained sabotage activities against important targets in the enemy-held islands. During sustained blockade of SLOC, [the JCC and command organ] should carry out rigorous monitoring {\u76d1\u63a7 jiankong} of EM signals and hydroacoustic signals {shuisheng xinhao} in the important blockade operational areas, to timely grasp the dynamic state {dongtai} of the enemy penetration force-strengths $\\{ t u p o b i n g l i \\}$ and antisubmarine force-strengths {fanqian bingli}. For newly detected enemy concealed electronic information targets and mobile detection and early warning {jidong tance yujing} systems, [they should] carry out reconnaissance and positioning $\\{ d i n g w e i \\}$ , and conduct jamming and suppression or destruction and sabotage of them. [They should] strengthen surface R&S {haimian zhencha, jianshi} of the blockade mine area $\\{ l e i q u \\}$ situation, to provide intelligence assisting support {qingbao zhiyuan} for timely organizing of activities such as follow-up mine laying $\\{ h o u x u b u l e i \\}$ and submarine ambush and roving/hunting {qianting shefu, youlie}. [They should] organize IO reconnaissance strengths to complement the other reconnaissance strengths in carrying out detection and positioning of commercial ships and transports {yunshu jianchuan} which violate restricted navigation areas $\\{ j i n h a n g q u \\}$ , and swiftly ascertaining their nature, to provide target information for the blockade force-strengths implementing of interception, visiting and inspection {\u4e34\u68c0 linjian}, and seizure $\\{ n a b u \\}$ , and to assistsupport and complement the naval operations $\\{ h a i s h a n g z u o z h a n \\}$ strengths in driving away {\u9a71\u79bb quli}, intercepting, and striking at transports which enter the restricted navigation areas. During sustained blockade of air lines of communication {kongzhong jiaotongxian}, [the JCC and command organ] should organize IO reconnaissance strengths to complement the other reconnaissance strengths in timely ascertaining the attributes $\\{ s h u x i n g \\}$ and quantity of aerial vehicles {hangkongqi} entering our no-fly areas {jinfeiqu} and their adjacent air zones, to provide target intelligence for the aviation forces and surface-to-air missile [SAM] units {dikong daodan budui}; [end of page 287] and [they should] organize information attack strengths to conduct jamming and suppression of the information systems of enemy-nature {\u654c\u6027 dixing} aerial vehicles entering the no-fly areas, so as to assist-support and complement our aviation forces and SAM units in driving them away, forcing their landing, and intercepting and striking at them. When conducting sustained sabotage of important targets on the enemy-held islands, [the JCC and command organ] should organize information attack strengths in jamming, destroying, or sabotaging the enemy\u2019s important information system targets, to assist-support the strike activities of the Second Artillery Corps and of the naval and Air Force aviation forces {hai, kongjun hangkongbing}. In the sustained blockade phase, [the JCC and command organ] also should, based on operational needs and requirements, apply network attack means to execute attacks against the network systems of the enemy\u2019s counter-blockade operational SoS; uninterruptedly exploit various types of public opinion propaganda means and PSYWAR weapons to execute psychological attacks against the enemy, demonstrate our military\u2019s operational will and resolve, and induce anti-war [sentiment] and war-weariness {fanzhan he yanzhan qingxu} in the enemy military and civilians; and thoroughly organize information defense activities with our important information system targets as the key points. # IV. IO activities in the phase of concluding the campaign\u2026288 When concluding the campaign in a blockade campaign, the JCC and his command organ should continue to thoroughly organize IO activities, to timely provide assisting support for our blockade force-strengths in safe withdrawal from the blockade sea and air zones or when shifting into a new campaign pattern. When the blockade force-strengths withdraw from the battlefield, [the JCC and command organ] should organize IO reconnaissance to complement the other reconnaissance strengths in rigorous surveillance of the movements {dongxiang} of enemy ships and aircraft, to guard against enemy surprise raids $\\{ t u r a n x i j i \\}$ , and organize information attack strengths for key point jamming and suppression of enemy airborne and shipborne radar and command guidance communication {zhihui yindao tongxin}, so as to screen the blockade force-strengths in safely and swiftly withdrawing from the blockade operational area. When necessary, [they must] synthetically apply multiple means to create the false impression {\u5047\u8c61 jiaxiang} that our blockade force-strengths are continuing to be present in the blockade sea and air zones, so as to deceive and confuse the enemy. At the same time, [they should] strengthen examination of the news [media] $\\{ x i n w e n s h e n c h a \\}$ , and strictly control the scope and mode of broadcasts of operational information, to ensure the security and secrecy {anquan baomi} of the operational information. When preparing to shift into another campaign pattern, they should swiftly readjust the missions and disposition {tiaozheng\u2026 renwu he bushu} of the IO strengths, and do a good job of the next phase\u2019s IO preparations, to create the conditions for accomplishing the new campaign missions.

Within an island offensive campaign, in order to maintain the campaign initiative $\\{ z h u d o n g \\}$ , the engaging sides {jiaozhan shuangfang} will widely apply information operations [IO] means to first seize information dominance {zhixinxiquan}. Island offensive operations under informationized conditions {xinxihua tiaojianxia} will be carried out within a complex electromagnetic [EM] environment {dianci huanjing}; IO will infiltrate into every field $\\{ l i n g y u \\}$ and every direction of the campaign, and not only will be the guide {\u5148\u5bfc xiandao} for the campaign, but also will penetrate from the beginning to the end of the campaign. Seizing information dominance will have important significance for seizing and maintaining air dominance/supremacy {zhikongquan} and sea dominance {zhihaiquan} in the island offensive campaign, and even for seizing the initiative {zhudongquan} and ultimate victory in the entire campaign. The main missions of island offensive campaign IO are as follows: to organize and implement IO reconnaissance {zhencha}, with the key points on ascertaining the situation of the composition, deployment $\\{ p e i z h i \\}$ , and technical parameters $\\{ c a n s h u \\}$ of the enemy\u2019s reconnaissance and early warning systems $\\{ z h e n c h a y u j i n g x i t o n g \\}$ , command and control [C2] $\\{ z h i h u i k o n g z h i \\}$ systems, communication hubs {tongxin shuniu}, and weapons control $\\{ w u q i k o n g z h i \\}$ systems in the main operational direction {zhuyao zuozhan fangxiang} and important zones (sea zones) $\\{ d i ( h a i ) y u \\}$ ; to jam and suppress {ganrao yazhi} the information system critical nodes {guanjian jiedian} and important targets of the enemy\u2019s C2 centers, communication hubs, and radar [sets]; and to resist and defend against $\\{ k a n g y u \\}$ the enemy\u2019s outer space $\\{ t a i k o n g \\}$ , air, ground, and sea information attacks $\\{ x i n x i g o n g j i \\}$ , so as to ensure our operational information security [INFOSEC] {xinxi anquan $\\}$ and the normally brought into play effectiveness {xiaoneng} of the information systems.

During the Kosovo War, the US military, besides applying traditional EW means, also widely employed a good many new-concept weapons {xin gainian wuqi} to execute crushing strikes {huimiexing daji} on the information systems and electric power systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] {\u5357\u8054\u76df nan lian meng}. For example, it repeatedly used conventional EM pulse bombs [E-bombs] {dianci maichong dan}, leading to \u201clarge-area paralysis\u201d of the FRY\u2019s electronic information systems. The US military also for the first time used carbon-fiber graphite bombs {tan xianwei shimo zhadan} to specially strike at and sabotage the FRY\u2019s electric power systems. After this type of bomb exploded in the air, it could produce large quantities of long thin carbonfiber strips; once these strips fell onto high-voltage transmission lines or transformers, they could create short-circuits, and thus incinerate the power transmission equipment and paralyze the electric power system. It is thus clear that new-concept weapons became a new means of EW. In [the history of] human war, the Kosovo War was the first large-scale war reported over the Internet {hulianwang}. As soon as the war began, NATO exploited the Internet, and repeatedly at great length {\u8fde\u7bc7\u7d2f\u724d lianpian leidu} reported the so-called true state of the war $\\{ z h a n z h e n g z h e n x i a n g \\}$ , to prepare the public {\u9e23\u9523\u5f00\u9053 mingluo kaidao} for the war\u2019s actions $\\{ x i n g j i n g \\}$ . Simultaneously with this, the FRY, in order to counterattack {fanji} NATO\u2019s propaganda warfare, also exploited Internet sites {zhandian} to constantly transmit its own voice to the entire world. Via the Internet, it in good time transmitted NATO\u2019s savage acts {baoxing} in the war onto networks, and sent out reconnaissance information consistent with the identifying characteristics {shibie biaoshi} of its information and intelligence systems. [end of page 39] At the same time, the FRY fabricated its own battlefield information and projected false intelligence {jiaqingbao} to deceive the coming enemy. The FRY military also fully exploited NATO\u2019s abundant Internet information resources, over the \u2018Net collected information resources on the weapons and equipment of all NATO nations which participated in the air raid activities, and thus provided powerful assisting support $\\{ z h i y u a n \\}$ for its anti-air raid operations. In addition, ever since NATO had first launched air raids against the FRY, NATO\u2019s official website $\\{ g u a n f a n g w a n g z h a n \\}$ had constantly suffered attacks by computer hackers $\\lbrace h e i k e \\rbrace$ . Several computer warriors $\\{$ \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6597\u58eb jisuanji doushi} of the FRY exploited computer software, sneaked into NATO\u2019s server connecting to the Internet, and within a short time injected several thousand illicit pieces of information, which caused problems such as the NATO website appearing to be blocked $\\{ d u s e \\}$ and user access {yonghu fangwen} having difficulty. NATO\u2019s internal $\\{ n e i b u \\}$ e-mail system also was honored with hacker [intrusions], and every day it received more than 2000 \u201celectronic bombs\u201d {\u201cdianzi zhadan\u201d} of illicit mail. According to a NATO spokesperson who declined to reveal his or her name, during the war some of NATO\u2019s computer websites had suffered heavy losses {zhongchuang} inflicted by computer viruses {jisuanji bingdu} coming from the FRY. News reports said that FRY computer experts, under the assistance of Russian hackers, had once attacked into the C2 system of the US Navy\u2019s Nimitz aircraft carrier {\u201cNimizi\u201d hao hangkong mujian $\\}$ , and caused its communication to be out of order $\\{ s h i l i n g \\}$ for up to several hours. In addition, the US FBI\u2019s website and other government websites also suffered the attacks of hackers, causing several websites for long periods to be in a closed status {zhuangtai}. The great network war $\\{ w a n g l u o \\ d a z h a n \\}$ which broke out during the Kosovo War broke new records in the operational patterns within humankind\u2019s recorded history of war. The adoption of multiple means to implement PSYWAR was another prominent feature of the Kosovo War. The U.S.-led NATO\u2019s tactics $\\left\\{ c e l u e \\right\\}$ of \u201ctroops who subdue the enemy without battle\u201d {\u201c\u4e0d\u6218\u800c\u5c48\u4eba\u4e4b\u5175\u201d \u201cbuzhan er quren zhibing\u201d} already had its proponents {\u60c5\u6709\u72ec\u949f qingyou duzhong}, who fully recognized the principle of \u201cto take the enemy by force, first capture their hearts\u201d {\u201c\u593a\u4eba\u5148\u593a\u5fc3\u201d \u201cduoren xian duoxin\u201d}, and placed PSYWAR in an important position. At the beginning of April [1999], Britain\u2019s Foreign Secretary [Robin] Cook {\u5e93\u514b kuke} in a public address said that the FRY\u2019s First Lady Mila and her children had quietly left Yugoslavia and gone to another country. This sensational {\u8038\u4eba\u542c\u95fb songren tingwen} news was transmitted to Yugoslavia, and naturally played a certain role in confusing the people. This is because if it were really just as Cook had said, then it meant that Milosevic {\u7c73\u6d1b\u820d\u7ef4\u5947 miluosheweiqi} had already made preparations for defeat. On 27 May, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia [ICTY] {\u524d\u5357\u56fd\u9645\u6218\u72af\u6cd5\u5ead qiannan guoji zhanfan fating} inspector [Louise] Arbour {\u963f\u5c14\u5207\u5c14 aerqieer} announced that she was prosecuting for war crimes Milosevic and four other former Yugoslavian leaders. [end of page 40] This also was a new product of the PSYWAR cooked up {paozhi} by the leaders of the U.S., UK, and other nations. Its intent $\\{ y i t u \\}$ was unusually clear: to isolate the FRY leaders and to create in them enormous psychological fright {xinli konghuang}. When carrying out the campaign operations-research-based planning {zhanyi chouhua}, they considered PSYWAR content and objectives {mubiao} within it. At the start of the air raids, almost 100 personnel of the $4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ PSYWAR Group {dadui} $[ 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ PSYOP Group] subordinate to the US Special Operations Command [SOCOM] {tezhong zuozhan silingbu} at top speed were moved from the U.S. to Italy. Some [members] even penetrated deep into the Kosovar \u201cAlbanian Liberation Army\u2019s\u201d [KLA\u2019s] {\u79d1\u7d22\u6c83 \u201c\u963f\u65cf \u89e3\u653e\u519b\u201d kesuowo \u201cazu jiefangjun\u201d} controlled area, drew up {niding} PSYWAR activities courses of action [COAs] {xingdong fang\u2019an}, and conducted a multilevel, fulldimensional PSYWAR offensive $\\{ g o n g s h i \\}$ against Yugoslavia. First, they set up the \u201cNATO PSYWAR Broadcast TV Station.\u201d This group recommended that the US Air Force [USAF] dispatch 6 EC-130 aircraft. At an altitude of 10,000 meters, group personnel exploited the medium-wave and FM bands {zhongbu, tiaopin boduan} used by Yugoslav State radio and TV stations, and in the Serbian language broadcast PSYWAR information. Next, together with the NATO International Military Staff HQ {canmoubu} Public Relations Department, as well as related intelligence institutions, they joined hands to prepare PSYWAR propaganda materials and false information {jiaxinxi}, which they widely sent out to the mass media. In addition, based on PSYWAR tenets, they recommended strikes on susceptible targets $\\{ m i n g a n m u b i a o \\}$ , including the Yugoslavian president\u2019s official residence and bombing of the Yugoslavian electric power and water supply systems. In order to keep the Yugoslavian people from timely obtaining true information on the air raids and anti-air raid [activities], NATO before dawn on 23 April bombed the Yugoslav State TV station, and on the $2 7 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ it used missiles to destroy the TV broadcasting tower mounted at the top of the Serbian Socialist Party\u2019s HQ building. The main characteristics of IO at this time were as follows: first is that IO had become an important component of the joint campaign. IO had become the \u201cfirst gun\u201d fired in an independent phase of the joint campaign, even before the launch of the joint campaign\u2019s overall activities {zongti xingdong}; it moreover penetrated from start to finish of the entire campaign. This [point] had a typical embodiment within the Persian Gulf War and Kosovo War. Second is that IO technology had produced qualitative leaps: various types of IO weapons had emerged in an endless stream {\u5c42\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a77 cengchu buqiong}, and informationized weapons had become \u201cmultipliers\u201d of combat power. During the Kosovo War, the sorties into action {chudongde jiaci} by the NATO armed forces\u2019 EW aircraft constituted more than $40 \\%$ of the total number of aircraft sent into action. In addition, the \u201cdecoys\u201d towed by aircraft conducted air raids, and also acquitted themselves splendidly during the war. One new type of IO weapon \u2013 the EMP bomb [Ebomb] \u2013 [end of page 41] saw application in real combat. Third is the maturation of IO thought and the proposal of integrated {wanzheng} IO theory, as well as the establishment of the corresponding institutions. Before the Gulf War, studies of IO only involved individual efforts $\\{ x i n g w e i \\}$ sporadically carried out by theorists within and outside of the militaries of various nations; but after this war, they then became studies by the nation\u2019s leading [researchers] $\\left\\{ z h u d a o \\right\\}$ and efforts of practice. This phase of research on IO further deepened, and also further deepened studies on fighting methods {zhanfa} for IO. In 1992, the US Department of Defense issued DoD Directive {zhiling} 3600.1\u2014 Information Warfare {xinxizhan}, which began to study IO theory in key point based, phase-by-phase manner {you zhongdian, fenjieduan di}, and developed IW capabilities. The fiscal year 1995 US Defense Report carried out a delimiting {jieding} of IO, and the fiscal year 1996 Defense Report at fairly great length discussed IO issues. The US military\u2019s Joint Vision 2010 {2010 nian lianhe gouxiang} and its accompanying full set of {peitao} trans-century long-range plans $\\{ g u i h u a \\}$ for the various services and arms {junbingzhong} all at very great length discussed the importance and main content of IO. In 1993, DoD took the lead in carrying out structural adjustment {tiaozheng} of its directly subordinate institutions, and clarified the duties $\\{ z h i z e \\}$ of each department in terms of developing IO capabilities. In 1994, it established an Information Systems Security Center {xinxi xitong anquan zhongxin}, Joint Staff C2 Warfare Center {lianhe canmoubu zhihui kongzhizhan zhongxin}, and Joint Staff IO Bureau {lianhe canmoubu xinxi zuozhan ju}. The US Army, Navy, and Air Force respectively established the corresponding IO institutions, and issued the corresponding operational regulations {zuozhan tiaoling}.", "metadata": "2021-10-12 Lectures Joint Campaign Information Operations CASI_EN.md", "judgement": true}, "15": {"text": "The large language model analyzes a large amount of data through algorithms, identifies the cognitive habits and psychological weaknesses of specific groups or individuals, and then manipulates their cognition and behavior through customized information push. ? The \"Comprehensive Evaluation of the Credibility of the GPT Model\" report points out that the potential of the large language model to be weaponized and used in cognitive warfare lies in the fact that the content generated by the ChatGPT algorithm is a mixture of real information and false and forged information, which induces the user's attention and perceptual stimulation. \u2462 ChatGPT's generative algorithm strategy takes advantage of this human cognitive and psychological tendency, that is, when the information contains known and credible elements, the public is more likely to accept the authenticity of the entire information. This \"real and fake\" mixed strategy greatly increases the difficulty of distinguishing the authenticity of information, making false information easier to be believed. ? Generative AIs such as ChatGPT mix facts and non-factual information they generate to create biased, misleading, and agitational content to impact existing cognition, and have the initial offensive and defensive potential for psychological manipulation and cognitive deception. ChatGPT can disguise misleading content as seemingly credible and logically coherent content, and its confident tone further enhances its cognitive deception, increasing users' trust and acceptance of misleading or biased content. Compared with \"non-kinetic wars\" such as psychological warfare, information warfare, public opinion warfare, and cyber warfare, artificial intelligence cognitive warfare based on large language models has significant advantages in five aspects: concealment, efficiency, accuracy, flexibility, and destructiveness: 1. The concealment of AI cognitive warfare. Compared with physical warfare, AI cognitive warfare is more covert and difficult to defend. Large language models have greatly expanded the scope and depth of cognitive warfare, invisibly manipulating information flows to create seemingly natural false information or misleading opinions. Its concealment and extensiveness make it difficult for traditional information and cognitive defense strategies to work. The cognitive warfare content generated by large language models usually exaggerates facts, exaggerates panic, or creates hostility. It is difficult to be identified as false content under information disguise, and can quickly trigger public emotional resonance and chain reactions. Because the United States has the first-mover advantage of generative artificial intelligence, if it embeds the cognitive warfare content of large language models into its public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and information warfare against China, it will be able to take advantage of the United States' powerful \"water army\" scale advantage in automatically generating accounts and publishing content, and use large language models to... --- The algorithm recommendation mechanism embedded in the model and social platform and the penetration of social relationship chains realize active \"feeding\", large-scale interaction and forwarding. \"Therefore, the cognitive content generated in batches by large language models is embedded in the cognitive confrontation of psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and intelligence warfare as the \"raw materials\" of cognitive attack and defense. This potential scenario will pose a national security risk to China that cannot be ignored. The cognitive content generated by large language models is more interactive, covers a wider range, and is more likely to affect individual cognition. In the daily use of ChatGPT, users are very likely to be deeply intervened by the cognitive content of human-computer interaction and deep learning without knowing it, and eventually their accumulated cognitive pressure will overwhelm the existing cognitive structure of the brain. At the same time, the application of artificial intelligence technology has also made fake news and deep fake content more realistic and difficult to identify, strengthening the complexity and concealment of artificial intelligence cognitive warfare. # **Second, the efficiency of AI cognitive warfare** It is reflected in the cost-benefit efficiency advantage. Algorithmic cognitive warfare breaks through the geographical limitations of traditional warfare, transforming the form of warfare from regional, physical domain material conflicts to global, virtual domain warfare. The key advantage of algorithmic cognitive warfare is that it almost eliminates the direct risks of war. Algorithmic cognitive warfare greatly improves combat effectiveness with its high efficiency and low cost, and minimizes the direct risks in war. # **The third is the accuracy of AI cognitive warfare** Large language models and deep learning algorithms can analyze massive amounts of data and identify the psychological and behavioral patterns of target groups, thereby enabling more accurate information operations and psychological manipulation. Driven by large language models, AI cognitive attack and defense demonstrates the characteristics of precise perception, precise prediction, and precise calculation, achieving clarity of combat objectives and customization of content generation. Large language models accurately portray user personality and cognitive characteristics based on massive data sources and feedback content, and use algorithms to build a portrait of the target's value orientation and way of thinking and match cognitive attack and defense content, achieving highly customized and precise feeding of \"cognitive bombs\" and precise \"sniping\" of user behavior patterns, preferences, and opinion tendencies. # **Fourth, the flexibility and adaptability of AI cognitive warfare** ## **This is reflected in the iterative and self-reinforcing characteristics of AI models. The self-learning and optimization capabilities of AI models mean that they can continuously adjust their strategies to adapt to countermeasures. Through continuous selection, large language models can learn more effective propaganda methods to better manipulate the emotions of the target population and gradually undermine their ability to judge objective facts. The cognitive combat environment is changing rapidly, and the content generated by the model also needs to be continuously adjusted and optimized as the environment changes. First, supervised fine-tuning can guide the large language model to be more in line with actual combat needs when generating cognitive attack and defense content based on pre-designed training data and refined parameter adjustments.** Secondly, AI can define a set of reward models for evaluating the quality and deviation of model-generated content, and then use content feedback to guide the model to gradually improve the generation strategy and reward function, continuously iterate training, and gradually learn to generate content that better meets the needs of cognitive operations. For example, by changing word embeddings, by labeling and changing the understanding and generation methods of certain specific words or concepts in the model, the weight of word embeddings can be gradually adjusted to make the generated content gradually fit the needs of cognitive attack and defense. \u2460 # **Fifth, the destructiveness of AI cognitive warfare** The potential weaponization of cognition by the Big Language Model and its potential involvement in cognitive warfare significantly increase the destructiveness and lethality of information. The two-way embedding of algorithm-driven large language models and deepfake technology can not only be used to spread misleading information, shape and manipulate public opinion, but also deepen the rift between hostile parties and undermine their stability and mutual trust. The destructiveness of AI cognitive warfare far exceeds that of traditional propaganda warfare, public opinion warfare, and information warfare, and it achieves the goal of conducting large-scale and precise cognitive distortion operations without the need for human intervention. In particular, the continuously improved multimodal capabilities of large language models have greatly expanded the means of cognitive adversarial warfare, making it possible to use large language models to conduct saturation-based precise cognitive attacks on specific audiences and to use deep fake technology to interfere with enemy decision-making cognition. ChatGPT advances the intelligent level of false information production. It is based on the generation and recognition of multimodal data, images and videos, and can generate realistic false images and videos to commit fraud. ## **From a tactical point of view, once ChatGPT and other cognitive weapons are weaponized, the attacker can use its advantages of \"big data top ten models $+$ strong algorithms\" to achieve large-scale production and deployment of \"cognitive ammunition\", quickly saturate the opponent's information environment, form a powerful cognitive offensive and contain the opponent's cognitive thinking, and achieve comprehensive suppression of cognitive offensive and defensive situations. From a strategic point of view, artificial intelligence cognitive warfare focuses on attrition warfare and protracted warfare, destroying or interfering with enemy cognition based on artificial intelligence means such as large language models. Algorithmic cognitive warfare based on ChatGPT can invisibly weaken the enemy's fighting will and resistance in an extremely covert way. Algorithmic cognitive warfare uses the mode of attrition warfare and protracted warfare to maximize the impact on the opponent's cognitive stability without spending any military cost, and achieve the goal of \"defeating the enemy without fighting\".** # **3\\. Artificial Intelligence Cognitive Warfare: Text, Narrative, and Mobilization** Since large language models have the prospect of being \"generalized\" and \"weaponized\" on a large scale by countries with artificial intelligence technology advantages and used for external cognitive offense and defense, the \"weaponization\" process of artificial intelligence cognitive warfare has become an issue that needs to be analyzed. Specifically, artificial intelligence cognitive warfare includes three components: \"ammunition\", \"weapons\" and \"targets\". # **First** Information flows carried by text are the \"ammunition\" of AI cognitive warfare. First, ChatGPT is used to generate massive texts or information flows that exceed the target's cognitive processing ability or thinking comprehension ability, so as to achieve a state of content overload and information drowning. The cognitive warfare attacker creates excessive content and text that is difficult to distinguish between true and false based on the large language model, and uses the target group's cognitive confusion to induce them to lose their way in the massive text and information and fall into a cognitive trap. Secondly, once the target group falls into a state of cognitive confusion, the ChatGPT algorithm \"tailors\" an information cocoon for them, selectively emphasizing or amplifying certain information, while ignoring or distorting other information, causing the audience to have cognitive biases in their judgment of facts. After the manipulator creates an information cocoon, it will further solidify the audience's attitude, leading to cognitive bias and cognitive closure, and shaping a false \"cognitive environment.\" # **second** ## **Narrative is the \"weapon\" of AI cognitive warfare. Narrative is not only a tool for disseminating information, but also a core mechanism for organizing and interpreting information. Due to the limitations of human individual social cognition in processing information, manipulators can take advantage of people's \"cognitive loopholes\". \"Weaponized narrative\" plays a key role in AI algorithm cognitive warfare, and acts as a \"narrative bomb\" in the process of cognitive formation or change through narrative manipulation. Large language models have the ability to process massive amounts of data and generate targeted content. They influence the opponent's psychology and decision-making process by manipulating information flow and narrative methods, making them a powerful cognitive warfare tool. It can be seen that large language models can create and disseminate narratives that are highly targeted and contagious in a very short period of time, identify cognitive loopholes and emotional trends through precise algorithms, and generate narrative content that meets the expectations of specific target audiences, making AI cognitive warfare more effective in influencing the opponent's cognition and emotions.** The large language model can create and produce influential, infectious, and provocative event narratives. Third, mobilization is the \"target\" of AI cognitive warfare. The potential of AI in cognitive warfare is reflected in its ability to guide cognition and conduct propaganda and mobilization. The emotional expression of cognitive domain warfare generated by the large language model is manifested as explicit expression or implicit pre-embedding, deeply rooted in clear opinions and attitudes or vague cognitive positions, obtaining the other party's emotional recognition and empathy, and achieving emotional mobilization. ChatGPT generates false content and puts users in a high cognitive pressure environment where text and content are repeatedly exposed and repeatedly stimulated. The cognitive threshold and cost of users accepting false content will continue to decrease, and ultimately \"reversing black and white\" will be achieved. Users are continuously induced and manipulated in a high cognitive pressure environment, gradually accepting and trusting false texts and information, and their vigilance and critical thinking ability decrease. # **Therefore, the two hypotheses to be tested in this study can be expressed as:** # **Hypothesis 1: \u201cConfusing right and wrong\u201d** Artificial intelligence large language models are able to \"confuse right and wrong\" and shape cognition and thinking patterns by selectively presenting information and falsifying facts, thus having the potential for algorithmic cognitive warfare. Artificial intelligence technology has significantly enhanced the attacker's ability to launch cognitive attacks in cognitive warfare. The large language model widely mobilizes public opinion and forces, driving negative emotions such as suspicion, panic and anxiety to continue to ferment within the opponent, inducing the opponent's internal instability or even collapse, and ultimately gaining an overwhelming cognitive offensive advantage. ?Conflict in the cognitive domain aims to strategically exploit these competing functions and cognitive biases that limit the rationality of different actors in order to cause distortions in thinking and emotional representations and thus change decisions. The attacker conducts large-scale sentiment analysis and pattern recognition based on the model, which greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of the attacker in actively shaping the other party's information, psychology, emotions, thinking and other cognitive domain components. ?", "metadata": "CHN_Cognitive_Weaponization_Cognitive_Warfare_Artificial_Intelligence_University_International_Relations_Sep2024-2_llama-parse_en.md", "judgement": true}, "16": {"text": "The meaning of the latest \"Regulations on Military Political Work\" of the Communist Party of China in 2021 https://indsr.org.tw/respublicationcon?uid=12&resid=808&pid=1713 1. News highlights The Communist Party of China recently issued the latest revision of the \"Regulations on Military Political Work\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Regulations\"). It has been 10 years since the last revision. This legal adjustment related to the CCP\u2019s political army building and the party\u2019s leadership has once again attracted the attention and research of various countries. Since the \"Interim Regulations (Draft) on the Political Work of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\" was formulated and promulgated in 1930, the Political Work Regulations have always been the basis for the military's political work. They have been revised 12 times, with a total of 10 chapters and 74 articles. Political work is called the lifeline of the People's Liberation Army. It performs ideological, political, and organizational work, and is also responsible for the task of forging the soul of the military. [1] The following is a study and analysis of the meaning of the latest \"Regulations on Military Political Work\" of the Communist Party of China. 2. Security Implications The political work of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s military was founded in 1927 to imitate the Soviet Red Army. Mao Zedong formulated the system of division of labor among chiefs under the unified collective leadership of the party committee, which was the \"Three Bay Adaptation\" and became the beginning of the party's absolute leadership over the military. [2] In 1929, the Communist Party of China held the \"Gutian Conference\" to establish the relationship between the party and the army. Based on the principle of \"building the party ideologically and building the army politically\", it established the basic principles and systems for the party's leadership of the army and strengthened the party's centralized and unified leadership over the army. After the Gutian Conference, the \"Political Work Program\" and the \"Regulations on Political Work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army\" were promulgated, which promoted the institutionalization of political work and established the principle of \"the party commands the gun\", making political work the lifeline of the People's Liberation Army. [3] In 1930, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promulgated the \"Interim Regulations on the Political Work of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (Draft)\". This was the first \"Political Work Regulations\" of the CCP, which standardized its political work. [4] The People\u2019s Liberation Army of the Communist Party of China must be under the absolute leadership of the Party, and the highest command power belongs to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission; a political commissar is established in the units above the regiment level, and the military chief at the same level is the head of the unit, forming two chiefs Co-management. The political work of the Communist Party of China focuses on tasks such as party building, organizational work, political education, military manpower support management, and military propaganda. It constitutes an important factor in the combat effectiveness of the People's Liberation Army and is a fundamental guarantee for the party's absolute leadership over the military and the military's performance of its functions and missions. [5] It can be seen that the CCP\u2019s political work can effectively implement the party\u2019s mission and simultaneously grasp all the movements of the People\u2019s Liberation Army to respond to the rapidly changing situation. The promulgation of the \"Regulations\" this time is mainly in response to military reforms, which can be divided into the following three points: 1. The People's Liberation Army's reform system and corruption rectification actions to achieve the goal of strengthening the military. From the perspective of national defense strategy, in 2016 the People's Liberation Army of the Communist Party of China has completed \"Deepen the reform of national defense and the military\" and build a combat command system of \"Central Military Commission - Theater - Troops\", changing the Central Military Commission from 4 headquarters to 15 functional departments, and reorganizing 7 military regions into 5 theaters, forming \" The reform of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the main battle zone, and the main service construction\" has made the functional departments of the Military Commission, theater command institutions and service management agencies above the neck level, as well as military-level units below the neck level and the brigade, camp and company levels under the new system, the military organizational structure and The force system has been significantly reshaped, forming a flat command and accelerating the People's Liberation Army's maneuverability and flexible application space. [6] At the same time, the CCP internally promotes anti-corruption actions, investigates and punishes those who violate disciplines and laws, and improves military discipline to maintain the stability of the regime. [7] After five years of military reforms, the original \"Regulations\" were adjusted and the design and normative revisions were made from the regulatory level in an attempt to keep pace with the times and update the content according to the needs of the times to enhance the effectiveness of the PLA's joint operations. 2. Focus on preparing for war and improving combat capabilities. From the perspective of military strategy, Xi Jinping once pointed out: \"To be able to fight and win wars, the goal is to always be able to call upon them, be able to fight when they come, and win the war.\" [8] \"Regulations\" The party's direction is the direction of the PLA's political work. The central tasks of the party and the army determine the basic tasks of political work. It is particularly emphasized that political work must focus on preparing for war as the main task, and insist on playing a service guarantee role around the central tasks of the party and the army. In addition, the principles and requirements for organizing and carrying out political work during combat are proposed to ensure the organic integration and linkage of political work during combat and combat operations, and to improve the quality and efficiency of wartime political work. [9] In 2016, the CCP divided the original general political department into three departments, establishing the \"Political Work Department of the Military Commission\", the \"Discipline Inspection Committee of the Military Commission\" and the \"Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Military Commission\". At the same time, some functions of political work were divided into Achieving the goal of \"Military Commission General Administration\" includes adjusting the Military Commission headquarters structure and implementing a multi-departmental Military Commission system to consolidate the power of the Central Military Commission. [10] In addition, after the reform, the functions of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, which was originally responsible for the \"public affairs, procuratorate, and law\", were transformed into a \"staff service organization\", replacing the original \"leading organization\" and making the functions Toward areas such as party building, organizational work, and political education. In addition, the units responsible for the implementation of the \"Three War Wars\" have also been adjusted. In the past, the units managed by the General Political Department of the \"Three War Wars\" were transferred to specialized departments with division of labor. [11] The units responsible for the \"Three War Wars\" were transformed into professional and Informatization, in order to achieve the goals of military reform and strengthen the People's Liberation Army's joint command and combat capabilities, can it maximize the effectiveness of the \"three wars\", as shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Changes in responsible units before and after the military reform of the \"Three Wars of the Communist Party of China\" 3. Consolidating Xi Jinping's power by seizing military power. Xi Jinping took over as the leader of the 18th National Congress in 2012. In order to consolidate his position, he actively promoted \"anti-corruption\", eradicated all dissidents one by one, and created the \"Xi Family Army\". [12] In order to effectively and reliably control the real power of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the leader of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, emphasized in the latest Regulations the implementation of Xi Jinping\u2019s thoughts on strengthening the military, insisted on the party\u2019s absolute leadership over the People\u2019s Liberation Army, implemented the \u201cChairman of the Military Commission Responsibility System\u201d, and institutionally clarified the Central Military Commission Responsible for party work and political work in the military reflects the practical need for the Central Military Commission to fulfill its responsibilities of managing and governing the party after the reform of the military, so as to consolidate its role as the lifeline of political work. In addition, the review of the \"Regulations\" focuses on strengthening the party's leadership over the military's political work, and fully promotes the military to strengthen the \"four consciousnesses\", strengthen the \"four self-confidences\", and achieve \"two maintenances\" to achieve the goal of strengthening the military in the new era. [13] Therefore, it can be found that the revised \"Regulations\" continuously strengthen the party's leadership over the political work of the People's Liberation Army, and the party leads the party to ensure that it controls the military operations in all aspects. [14] Based on the above, Xi Jinping revised the \"Regulations\" to implement the rule of law for the political work after the military reform, control the operation of the military through political work, and strengthen the party's leadership over the military, so as to achieve \"the party commands the gun.\" Its main purpose is to consolidate Xi Jinping's power as a weapon and to control military power. Reference, trend analysis and judgment 1. One of the 20 major layout tools This article determines that the revision of the \"Regulations\" is one of Xi Jinping's 20 major layout tools. Use ideological education, laws and regulations, administrative management and other means to comprehensively manage the People's Liberation Army so that it can continue to maintain its leadership position. However, due to this impact on the original \"succession echelon model\" within the CCP, in order to avoid political Due to the changes in the situation, it is predicted that Xi Jinping will not easily step down as chairman of the Central Military Commission no matter what, and will continue to control military power and control all resources. This point can also be confirmed by the new \"Internet Public Opinion Bureau\" [15] established by the CCP. It is predicted that the CCP will continue to strengthen the control of internal and external network information, use the legal network as the party's mouthpiece, and effectively control the PLA's network. trends and the right to speak externally to control public opinion. 2. The People's Liberation Army is focusing more on military modernization and joint operations. The CCP's \"Regulations\" have \"changed and remained unchanged\". What has changed is: \"added and strengthened joint operations capabilities, focused on preparing for war, and adjusted professional division of labor. Everything is based on being able to fight and win wars.\" as the goal to ensure the centenary of the founding of the army in 2027 and the modernization of the army in 2035.\" What remains unchanged is: the principle of \"the party commands the gun\" never allows the gun to command the party, nor can it achieve the nationalization of the military. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army can be said to be a party army, controlled by the Communist Party (led by Xi Jinping). In addition, the expansion of the CCP\u2019s military power in the post-epidemic era is also worthy of our attention. The People\u2019s Liberation Army has intensively strengthened its military construction, adopted a series of formulation or revision of laws and regulations, built a complete military and political system, and moved towards running the army in accordance with the law and strengthening the army in accordance with the law, so that the People\u2019s Liberation Army Flatten the command, launch mobilization and general warfare in the shortest possible time, and continuously verify the actual combat effectiveness through military exercises, significantly improve the combat effectiveness of the People's Liberation Army, and move towards the goal of \"Dream of a Strong Army\" and \"Dream of a Strong Nation\", such as the 2020 \"Joint Operations\" \"Outline (Trial)\" to improve and strengthen war preparedness capabilities; the 2021 \"National Defense Law\" adds new development interests; the 2021 \"Coast Police Law\" adds new uses of weapons, etc. It can be seen from this that the CCP\u2019s active military modernization layout has aroused doubts and worries in neighboring countries and other countries around the world, especially cross-strait relations, disputes over the waters surrounding Diaoyutai, and various islands and reefs in the South China Sea, etc., adding more variables to East Asia\u2019s regional security.", "metadata": "Meaning of CPC Newest Regulation Military Political Work in 2021_en.docx", "judgement": true}, "17": {"text": "They have accurately assessed the major opponents and directions of threat to our national security at each time so that we have been able to resolutely defend our national unification and territorial integrity and protect the modernization of our national defense, security and socialism under very complicated and difficult conditions. In the mid-1950s, as foreign forces led by the US strategically encircled us so severely that they could attack us, the Party Central and the Central Military Committee (CMC) knowing this situation, decided to make the southeast coast area as our principal strategic direction. Between the 1960s and 1970s, as the Sino-Soviet relations broke up and the USSR stationed a large army along the Chinese border to deter us more seriously, the leadership resolutely moved the principal direction to the three northern regions. In the 1980s, according to the new international situation, they changed the principal strategic direction again. Through timely adjustments, we have always kept our strategically active position. Section Two:  Striving to Accomplish Goals of Strategic Actions While Paying a \t\t\tSmall Price Goals of strategic actions are the direct political fruits that war wants to reap. They are specifications of strategic goals as well as the starting and ending points of a series of strategic planning and management including setting strategic guiding principles, drafting strategic plans, confirming strategic missions, deciding strategic deployments, selecting strategic means and organizing strategic support. Thus, deciding on the goals of strategic actions is an important principle concerning the whole situation. Deciding goals of strategic actions is an essential substance of setting military strategy. Clausewitz once pointed out: \u201cStrategy is the application of combat for fulfilling goals of war. Thus, we must set goals that are adaptable to the objectives of war for the whole military actions.\u201d Goals of strategic actions are the indispensable contents for planning and directing the whole situation of military strategy. They can be divided into general goals and specific goals. The former controls the entire process of the strategic situation and is the direct manifestation of political ends in military actions. The latter is the political end that each strategic stage seeks, each strategic strength and each fighting means must be separately accomplished and the decomposition and thinning of general goals for horizontal connection in stages of time and other aspects. Only having set the general goals can we make an overall plan and deploy the whole military situation as well as solve a series of important strategic problems including war preparation, military building and strategic guiding principles effectively. Meanwhile, only by setting specific goals can we base our general strategic attempt at dividing the steps and directions necessary to achieve strategic actions and enhance the objectives and plans of war to ensure that goals are fulfilled. For example, in the initial period of the War of Liberation, based on the general goals of \u201cstriking down Chiang Kai-shek and liberating the entire China,\u201d Mao Zedong had decided the general goal for the PLA was to eliminate 100 brigades of the KMT troops in five years. He then set a specific, concrete number to be annihilated annually for each theater. These goals had changed the ratio of strength between the PLA and the KMT forces and become the key to accomplishing the objective of war. Setting goals of strategic actions is the prerequisite condition for selecting strategic means. The aim of military strategy is to combine and unify strategic aims and means. Goals of strategic actions are the precondition for choosing strategic means; strategic means is the practical measure of achieving strategic goals. They are closely related, and both must be present. Goals of strategic actions are the direction and standard for choosing strategic means. Different goals need different means, or the same goal can choose different means. The key is that the two must be properly planned and managed. With clear-cut goals of strategic actions, the strategic director can change the use of them according to military situations, correctly calculate the problems of how to develop and apply military forces to avoid a divorce between them. Based on the need of the goals of strategic actions, he can improve targeting at the application, flexibility and adaptability of strategic means and accurately employ the methods of actual fighting and deterrence to form mobile and flexible strategy and tactics. In short, only being under the guidance of correct goals of strategic actions can the application of strategic means meet the requirement of political and military struggles. This will bring the efficacy of all kinds of strategic actions into full play to form a whole operational might and render a better service to the fulfillment of political objectives. Setting goals of strategic actions usually should meet the following requirements: First, the goals must be in keeping with the basic national interest. They are a specific manifestation of general national policy and objectives in the military field. Their setting must take the principle of maintaining and defending the national interest. In terms of politics, the most important goal is political independence, sovereignty integrity and national unification, which are the most fundamental requirements. In terms of security, it is protecting territorial integrity and ocean rights to prevent them from foreign  encroachment, which is the most fundamental requirement to guarantee the fulfillment of other national interests. In terms of economy, it must provide the most powerful insurance for the safety of national economic construction. It should fully consider and embody the needs of national interests and be subordinate to and serve the objectives of the nation\u2019s political struggle in a certain period of time, which we must strive to accomplish even though there are difficulties and dangers. On the contrary, we should not act rashly in violation of national interest even though the goals can benefit us militarily. As a socialist nation observing an independent and autonomous foreign policy, the goals of strategic actions must uphold anti-aggression and anti-hegemony and protect world peace and national security. After the Cold War, although the environment for peripheral security has been relatively improved and massive armed invasion endangering China\u2019s survival could be avoided, hegemony and power politics, however, still exist and are developing. Foreign and domestic hostile powers are ganging up with each other to be crazily engaged in splitting  China. The historically inherited disputes over border areas and ocean rights are not yet totally settled and the threat of war is not completely eliminated; thus, goals of military strategic actions in the new era must fully consider the above situations and thoroughly satisfy the requirement of China\u2019s basic interests. Second, the goals must adapt to international situations. Correctly selecting goals of strategic actions has the aim of solving the security problem that China is facing at    certain times. Having an accurate understanding of the international situation is to macroscopically grasp major contradictions and the tendency of development of the world. The world strategic situation is a concentrated embodiment of the growth and decline as well as diversification and composition of comprehensive national strength of various countries. Its formation decides those countries\u2019 function and position in the international society. The powerful countries\u2019 tendency of aggression essentially reflects the nature and demand of their economic and political interests, which is an important factor to understand the relations of those countries, especially between great powers, and to correctly assess the whole situation. The tendency of war in the current world situation is a big issue affecting world security and to find out the kinetic reason for war is the basic way to analyze the threat of war. Development and change of the situation of peripheral security is an essential condition directly affecting national interests and a side view reflects the core problems among our neighboring countries, such as the contradiction of interests, strategic attempts and military movements. Thus, only by correctly understanding the international situation can we go along with the tide of history to catch the major conflict of interest among the deterring countries and correctly select our principal strategic direction. We can be clearer and more specific about the goals of military strategy and also be more practical in our targeting. Third, the goals must be beneficial to accomplishing our strategic objectives. Accomplishment of strategic goals is an important symbol of fulfilling military strategic objectives. As a form of specific manifestation of strategic objectives, strategic goals must appropriately and clearly embody all indexes of the objectives to make them not only practical and feasible but also satisfy strategic needs. We cannot set the goals too high to exceed the normal requirements of national interest and the actual capability of military forces and cause them to divorce themselves from strategic needs and move toward the opposite direction. Nor can we set them too low to make strategic objectives unable to be fulfilled on time and bring losses to our national interest. Therefore, when setting the goals, we must make them clear and specific and highly feasible in order to facilitate the grasping and conducting of them in military actions and ensure a smooth materialization of strategic objectives. Fourth, the goals must be compatible with strategic combat capability. Armed forces\u2018 strategic combat capability is a fundamental condition to materializing the goals of strategic actions. Strategic goals cannot be divorced from reality and raise missions that strategic combat capability cannot accomplish. Nor can we set the goals too high to abuse the means of strategic combat, and even set them too low to affect the materialization of strategic objectives. The mistakes of military adventurism and military conservatism have given China\u2019s revolutionary war unfavorable lessons or even failures; therefore, in order to keep strategic goals in line with the reality of strategic combat capability, we must \u201cdo what we can..\u201d It means that we must base the reality of strategic combat capability on set strategic goals and select means for strategic combat according to our needs. We must strive to heighten the level of strategic combat to make it adaptable to the need and to closely combine the application and building of military forces to lay a material foundation for the fulfillment of strategic goals. Fifth, we must attain the biggest victory with the smallest price. On the selection of goals of strategic actions, we should foster the concept of military effectiveness and results. We should never pay a huge sacrifice and price for a limited victory and advantage; instead, we should minimize the cost and sacrifice and strive to realize our strategic goals with the lowest price as it is an important display of the strategic director\u2019s superb art of command. For this reason, under modern conditions, when setting strategic goals, we must base our plans on the characteristics of modern high-tech warfare to select vulnerabilities in the enemy\u2019s operational system and strike them hard. We must try to go for the favorable and avoid the harmful and proceed to the real and bypass the false and use one soldier as ten. Unless the nation is in danger of life or death, we should never fight a decisive war at any cost. Under normal conditions, we should not fight to overcome the enemy if we can do it without fighting or not fight a large battle if a small battle can serve the purpose. We must strive to use a small battle or create a momentum to cause a strong psychological shock to the enemy to achieve the consequences of \u201csubduing the enemy without fighting\u201d or \u201csubduing the enemy by a small battle.\u201c Section Three: Never Fighting a Battle Unprepared or Unsure of Winning War is a big fundamental matter affecting the life and death, honor and shame and gain and loss of a country, a nation or a political group; thus, we must insist on the principle of being careful with war and conducting it with extra caution. When facing the threat of war or military pressure, the strategic director must calmly analyze the situation and weigh the pros and cons to carefully make strategic selections. He must not despise combat and rush to conclusions nor be timid and indecisive. He must strive to closely plan and be fully prepared and strive to win the war when the situation is more in our favor. I. Closely planning and being fully prepared War is full of unpredictable \u201ctraps\u201d and \u201cmist\u201d and is more unpredictable and less certain than other societal elements. Never fight a battle unprepared or unsure of winning,  requires close planning and fully being prepared before any military actions. In the ancient Chinese book of war, the teachings of \u201ccalculating in the temple,\u201d \u201cthe way of using forces is to plan first and then take action,\u201d \u201cto fight an enemy and win a war should have a plan first.\u201d  \u201cThe enemy is always defeated when beating it with a plan.\u201d  All emphasized the importance of close planning and being fully prepared. Clausewitz, the famous Prussian military theorist, believed planning operations and demands allowed each common action to achieve this sort of unification. Napoleon thought that everything would end in nothing if not planned beforehand. In the long practice of China\u2019s revolutionary war, Mao Zedong used the viewpoint of material dialectics to profoundly analyze the probabilities and uncertainties in wars and pointed out \u201cdue to the uncertainties in wars, to carry out planning in wars is more difficult than applying it in other undertakings. However, things stand when planned and fall apart when not. We cannot win victory in a war without previous planning and preparations.\u201d  He summarized a series of logic of military knowledge and strategic guidance, from reconnaissance, assessment to planning and preparation, thereby achieving a maximum unification of the probabilities and uncertainties in wars and military struggles and successfully solving the contradiction in the planning nature of subjective guidance and the probability in objective reality. II. Being sure of both subjective and objective conditions Being planned and prepared is the precondition of attaining victory, but it does not mean that we are sure of winning. As Mao Zedong said, \u201cWe do not fight a battle unprepared and unsure of winning, and we can fight a battle prepared but unsure of winning.\u201c  In order to fight a battle sure of winning, on the one hand, we must positively prepare all material conditions for defeating the enemy.", "metadata": "Science of Strategy 2001 (English).docx", "judgement": false}, "18": {"text": "Volume 18 Issue 7 July 2016 Ideological & Political WorkIdeological&PoliticalWork Journal of MilitaryTransportation University Vol.18No.7 July 2016 Analysis on the Psychological Elements of Decision Makers in Our Own Country Zhao Juan Department of Military Psychology, Armed Police Political College, Shanghai 200435) Abstract: In order to promote the development of my country's target strategic coercion and ensure the realization of national security strategy and national interests, this paper analyzes in detail the cognition and belief, emotion and emotion, needs and motivation, personality and style of decision makers in the target country of strategic coercion.

Keywords: strategic deterrence; decision-makers of target countries; psychological factors Since the advent of nuclear weapons, modern coercion has increasingly become the protagonist on the stage of military struggle as a strategy for total victory of \"subjugating the enemy without fighting\". At present, my country is in the great historical process of peaceful rise. To firmly grasp the \"period of important strategic opportunities that can make great achievements\", in addition to needing stronger coordination to resolve international conflicts and crises, we must also have stronger strategic authority to ensure the realization of national interests. Exploring and analyzing the psychological factors of the decision-makers in the target countries of strategic coercion is of great value for promoting the development of my country's target strategic coercion. Received date: 2016-01-23: Revised date: 2016-02-29 About the author: Zhao Juan (1979), female, associate professor The perceptions and Perceptions and beliefs are widely involved in the decision-making process of policymakers in strategically intimidating target countries. In fact, the decision-making process often begins with the attention and perception of a situation of strategic intimidation. In the opinion of political scientists, the perception of the threat of the undermining party by policymakers in the target country is important. If policymakers see another country as a threat, they can 74 It is often assumed that the other party has both strength and intent to hinder the achievement of its goals or endanger its national security. Memory often provides decision-makers with some information related to their decision-making, or decision-makers must use their memory of others and the impressions of others formed on the basis of this memory to explain the policy of the arrogant party. For example, the U.S. designation of certain countries as evil is rooted in those politicians' memories of the early actions of their leaders. Belief systems are more directly linked to decision-makers' decision-making behavior. Ollie Holsty points out that policymakers act on analysis of the situation and perceptions of other countries, which in turn depend on their belief systems. The knowledge of reality is part of the belief system, and the decision-making and behavior of decision-makers depend in part on the knowledge of reality. For example, in one crisis, the intimidating party ostensibly deployed an armoured corps in an attempt to force the target country to accept its demands, and the target country's decision makers assessed the possibility of war and decided whether to back down. However, assuming that the target country's decision makers learn that the tanks are old and do not have sufficient fuel and supplies to actually take military action, the decision makers will correct their beliefs and the final decision may be very different. Cognition and belief can not only guide decision makers to correctly understand the status quo, and rationally determine whether to challenge the intimidating party, but also induce them to develop cognitive biases through habitual and simplified paths, resulting in the failure of intimidation. Taking predisposition as an example, although the vast majority of correct inferences are also strongly influenced by predisposition, it is often paranoid and aspirational, causing decision makers to reject unfavorable evidence and only look at what they expect to see. to the result. For example, in the past 2015, the world was deeply troubled by security. Traditional security issues and non-traditional security issues intertwined. Conflicts and disasters emerged one after another. Then, fighting terrorism is the primary aspiration of many countries. Once there is trouble, the first thing governments consider is a terrorist attack, and quickly make a response plan. People generally see attacks on terrorists, but rarely see other adverse factors, such as people's helplessness and political factors. Another example is the incident of Turkey's downing of a Russian military plane. People must first think of Russia's military retaliation against Turkey, and eagerly expect it to happen, but the result is a series of sanctions and Braille attacks. The sentiment and Moreover, the decision-making of the decision-makers of the standard country under the strategic coercion is often full of Volume 18 Issue 7 Journal of Military Transportation Academy Look at strong negative emotions and emotions, which are related to their methods of challenging their demands and intimidating them. The target country often initiates challenges based on dissatisfaction with the status quo, and the strategic coercion, which is mainly based on threats and force, shows the determination of the intimidating country to completely veto the challenger\u2019s intention to challenge. In this way, hatred, hostility, hatred, fear, despair, and anxiety and tension induced by crisis situations based on obstructed interests and desires run through the decision-making process of the decision-makers in the benchmark country. Fear is the most important emotional issue for decision makers in the target country, and it stems from the perception of one's own vulnerability to attack by other countries, which is almost universal in international politics. Fear, hostility, and military readiness of one adversary prompt the same response in the other, resulting in an escalating spiral of arms races between them, known as the \"fear dilemma.\" Simply put, the fear dilemma is that the actions of one country's policy makers to eliminate fear will inevitably increase the fear of other countries' policy makers. In fact, whether it is the theoretical concept of more than 2,000 years since Thucydides, or historical examples such as the origin of the Peloponnesian War and the US-Soviet Cold War, all show the \"fear dilemma\", the \"psychodynamics of conflict escalation\" \" is a major constant motivation in international relations1]. Howard believes that part of the cause of World War I was the increase in German power and the resulting fear of Britain. In order to ease Tokyo's policy during World War II, the United States and Western European countries first froze Japanese property and then imposed an oil embargo on Japan. The result has sparked fears among Japanese leaders that it will deprive them of the means to continue their rivalry with China and ultimately lead to the loss of any advantage. \"Correspondingly, it created a sense of despair in Tokyo, which was a basic prerequisite for the subsequent attack on Pearl Harbor.\" The terror threat in 2015, which engulfed most of the population in a sense of fear, led to a large influx of refugees. people Europe. According to the European Commission forecast, by the end of 2016, the total number of refugees entering Europe will reach 3 million. This has laid a legal foundation for countries to send troops into Syria to fight terrorist organizations. To this end, French President Francois Hollande stressed that the fight against terrorism \"is not over yet\"; European countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy and other European countries have declared war on terrorism; Nigeria and Cameroon have pledged to \"do whatever it takes\" to combat \"Boko Haram extremist groups, etc.\" It is also fear, but the fear caused by the ultimate weapon can greatly inhibit the desire of decision-makers to challenge. Khrushchev once said that (in a nuclear war) the living will be jealous of the dead. Because no one can predict that once a nuclear war starts, The destruction effect caused by the world, so the Soviet and American policymakers had to restrain their own behavior while being vigilant about the opponent's direction. Kenneth Waltz pointed out that during the Cold War, the \"fear of the whole beast sacrifice\" between the United States and the Soviet Union for the nuclear war was in the previous countries. July 2016 never appeared in the relationship. Today's threat of nuclear war has changed, but panic still plays a restraining role. The threat and counter-threat situation caused by strategic coercion can easily induce the nervousness of the decision makers of the target country. Under great pressure and high tension, decision makers' cognition may be completely different from usual, and even policy and behavior patterns may change, such as increased random behaviors, increased error rate, moving toward simpler and primitive response patterns, and adopting forceful responses. Problem solving, distraction, and reduced tolerance for ambiguity, among others. Holsty confirms that threatening tactics can significantly \"increase the tension that forces the other side to take action,\" which in turn increases the urgency of time and the danger of policymakers relying on those single, familiar options , regardless of whether these solutions are effective solutions to current problems. Research on World War I, the Korean War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis demonstrates that as tensions rise during crises, interactions between target country policymakers and intimidating parties diminish and become more stylized. At present, both the United States and Russia are developing and deploying strategic missile hypersonic glide warheads, which can theoretically break through any existing air defense system. In terms of developing new conventional means of strategic coercion, the United States, Russia and other countries are competing to develop conventional strategic containment capabilities centered on large-scale \"global rapid strike\" capabilities. On the basis of the establishment of the Global Strike Command in 2009, the U.S. military formulated a vision of \"global rapid strike\" before 2030, and developed a hypersonic cruise aircraft based on the SR-51A, which will integrate technology with aerospace aircraft to form an aerospace integration. The hypersonic aviation-spaceflight general-purpose platform will be used as our platform to upgrade the \"global rapid strike\" system to the \"global instant strike\" system, which poses a huge challenge to the existing nuclear weapons-based strategic containment system, which also forms tension between the two sides. pressure chain. The needs and The needs and motivations of policy makers in target countries have been widely recognized as important variables that lead to the failure of coercion. John Vasquez concluded that, at the individual level, conflicts erupted from the strong security needs and frustration motives of decision makers. Dignity-related \"face\" is an important class of needs and behavioral motives that compel decision-makers to take action. U.S. President Kennedy found that policymakers are often forced to respond to the actions of the other party for \u201cface\u201d reasons, which in turn will lead to a response from the other party, which ultimately leads to an escalation of armed conflict. .1] Karen Horney believes that those \"fanatical pursuit of honor\" decisions Juan: Analysis of the Psychological Elements of Decision Makers in Strategically Powerful Target Countries 175 Those who choose to do it in the form of external challenges. According to another study on the desire for power, the greater the desire for power displayed by the decision makers, the more aggressive the government will be [2]. The needs and motivations described above all seriously affect the stability of strategic authority. Often, overpowering needs and motives can easily induce a motive bias that can lead to a failure of coercion. Motivational biases are mostly produced in three ways. First, policymakers in target countries feel the need to address pressing domestic threats, including resolving internal conflicts, securing the ruling position of policymakers and their parties, and even protecting sectoral interests. Due to the difficult situation in the country, on the one hand, policy makers begin to believe that these threats can only be solved by challenging the intimidating party and changing the status quo.

This report examines the concept\u2019s history, current consensus, and enduring debates about what it entails. It also proposes a model of strategic culture as a complex system. What is strategic culture? After a review of relevant literature, we propose the following definition: An actor\u2019s1 strategic culture is composed of beliefs, experiences, assumptions, attitudes, and patterned behaviors that shape perceptions and preferences about its security-related interests, objectives, and activities. This definition reflects the consensus of most scholars. However, key issues remain concerning the relationship of strategic behavior to strategic culture, the social and political levels at which it operates, and how strategic culture can be modeled. Strategic behavior and strategic culture. Many scholars assert a recursive relationship between strategic culture and strategic behavior. Culture can impact behaviors, and behaviors sometimes reinforce elements of culture. However, if the concept of strategic culture is to be useful for national security analysis, it must predict some amount of an organization\u2019s strategic behavior. Including all strategic behaviors (e.g., nuclear postures, military investments, deployments, military conduct in war, operations under the level of armed conflict) in the definition of strategic culture potentially creates a tautology that undermines prediction. To avoid this tautology, only traditional, repeated, and patterned behaviors are included in our definition of strategic culture, allowing other elements of strategic behavior to emerge independently. Whether or not strategic culture influences strategic behavior remains an open question. Furthermore, there is consensus among scholars that factors, such as pragmatic material concerns, influence strategic behaviors and may override the effect of strategic culture all together. The influence of strategic culture on strategic behavior should be considered an empirical question to be tested in specific applications. Whose strategic culture matters? Strategic cultures exist at the international, national, and subnational levels, like political parties, popular opinion, intelligentsia, and powerful stakeholders. Any analysis of an actor\u2019s strategic behavior must identify which stakeholders and their associated strategic cultures actually influence it. Strategic culture as a complex system. Scholars have proposed that strategic culture is composed of identity, values, perceptions, and patterned behaviors. However, these elements are not independent; they can influence each other, creating a complex system of interrelationships. The complex system model we propose allows for the adaptation of the strategic culture concept to different nations and contexts. Background The 21st century operational environment challenges Western 20th century strategic concepts. The 21st century began with a US focus on asymmetric threats from non-state actors who held incompatibly different views, values, and motivations from the West. Meanwhile, adversarial states retooled their strategic approaches to compete with, and potentially undermine, Western power and the rules-based order by competing below the level of open armed conflict. The need to understand the motives, interests, and potential actions of these culturally different state and non-state actors led to renewed interest in the role that an actor\u2019s culture plays in its strategic behavior, and by extension, efforts to deter it. The concept that an actor\u2019s strategic culture2 influences its strategic behavior is both intuitive and ancient. It implies that different actors approach competition and conflict with different cultural lenses, assumptions, and perhaps behaviors.3 An early nod to strategic culture was proposed by the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu 2,500 years ago in his directive that \u201cone who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be endangered in a hundred engagements\u201d (Sun Tzu, 1963, p. 84). The ancient Greek historian Thucydides attributed the Athenians\u2019 power to their cultural and psychological attributes of innovation and restlessness (Thucydides, 1954, pp. 75-76). In The Conquest of Gaul, written around 50 BCE, Julius Caesar provided descriptions of Germanic culture and how he thought it inclined them for war. Centuries later, Clausewitz (1943, p. 125) stressed moral qualities, an element of culture, as a key dimension of war. An overview of strategic culture-like concepts in historical perspective is presented in... Prior to World War II, anthropologists of the culture and personality school of thought proposed that the way a people are socialized in a particular culture leads to the development of modal personality types that, in turn, give each culture a distinct character (Benedict, 1959). The leaders of this school of thought, Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict, used this approach during WWII in national character studies intended to provide insight into US, Japanese, and Soviet ways of war (Al-Rodhan, 2015; Benedict, 1946; Hinton, 2020; Mead, 1942). Thinking about the relationship of culture to strategy continued to be influenced by anthropologists after WWII. Nathan Leites (1951) credited Margaret Mead with influencing his notion of an operational code.4 The next major work on culture and strategy was Jack Snyder\u2019s landmark 1977 study of Soviet strategic decision-making in which he coined the term strategic culture. He defined it as: The sum total of ideas, conditioned emotional responses, and patterns of habitual behavior that members of a national strategic community have acquired through instruction or imitation and share with each other with regard to [nuclear] strategy (Snyder, 1977, p. 8). Snyder\u2019s work motivated academic scrutiny of the concept, resulting in several \u201cgenerations\u201d or schools of thought regarding what strategic culture is, whose strategic culture matters, and, most important, what (if any) effect strategic culture has on an actor\u2019s strategic behavior.5 This report will address these fundamental questions and propose a model of strategic culture along with illustrations of Russian and Chinese strategic culture. Strategic Culture\u2014The Debates Important epistemological, theoretical, and empirical issues about the definition and usefulness of \u201cstrategic culture\u201d remain unresolved. Nevertheless, assertions about the importance of the concept have persisted. In 2005, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) funded a workshop that involved about two dozen strategic culture researchers in an effort to resolve debates in the field, develop a methodology for systematic application of strategic culture to national security issues, apply that methodology, and provide a curriculum for teaching comparative strategic culture (Larsen, 2006). The DTRA workshop participants came to agreement on a number of crucial issues (Johnson, 2006). They agreed that strategic culture changes, although more slowly than other political influences, and therefore has the potential for long-term influences on strategic behaviors that typically occur on shorter timescales. Furthermore, all agreed that a state\u2019s strategic culture is only one among many factors that influence its strategic behavior. Pragmatic concerns, such as military might and alliances, also influence strategic behavior and may very well supersede any influence strategic culture may have on specific actions. The participants also agreed that in any nation, multiple sub-national groups and organizations are stakeholders who can have differing strategic cultures and that any complete analysis of a nation\u2019s strategic behavior must consider what these are, their interactions, and their influences on strategic behavior. As to whether strategic culture causes behavior, the contributors differed. Some, such as Colin Gray (1999, 2006), maintained that the concept is primarily useful for providing a context for understanding behavior. Others, such as Christopher Twomey (2006), remained skeptical that strategic culture could explain behavior. However, all contributors agreed that strategic cultures exist, can be systematically identified, and are important when contemplating strategic behavior.\nThe DTRA study produced a conceptual model of strategic culture based on four key variables: national identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens. Furthermore, the study authors proposed that these variables can be measured by dozens of inputs, such as sacred texts, historical political systems, interactions with other nations, demographics, and global norms. Their model is elaborated further below (see Strategic Culture as a Complex System: A Model). They applied their model to analyze US, Russian, Chinese, Israeli, Indian, Pakistani, Iranian, Syrian, and al Qaeda strategic cultures in an effort to demonstrate its usefulness (Larsen, 2006). Interest in strategic culture has continued (Adamsky, 2020; Antczak, 2018; Gotz & Staun, 2022; Hassner, 2014, 2016; Herd, 2022; Hinton, 2020; Johnson, 2021; Libel, 2020; Pillsbury, 2015; Rumer & Sokolsky, 2020; Scobell, 2014; Simalcik, 2020; Sinovets, 2016; Tellis, 2016; Zarobny & Salek-Iminska, 2021). Bloomfield (2012, p. 456) attempted to unite competing views of strategic culture and concluded that \u201cfrom Gray we take the notion that culture provides context; that it guides and shapes interpretation: we just have to accept that culture is a disaggregated thing with contradictory elements rather than a monolithic whole. From Johnston, we take the goal of building falsifiable theory.\u201d However, not all scholars find value in the concept; Echevarria (2013) concluded that strategic culture is a concept with \u201cmore problems than prospects\u201d that should be abandoned. Strategic Culture in US Deterrence Concepts Finally, it should be noted that the concept of strategic culture is both implicit and featured in important US national security documents. The concept of tailored deterrence introduced in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) directed that US deterrence strategies and operations should be tailored to different types of adversaries, such as nuclear states, non-nuclear state adversaries, and non-state terrorist organizations, and should include the different kinds of forces and military capabilities emergent in the 21st century (U.S. Department of Defense, 2006). The 2006 QDR also stressed the need for understanding the cultures of adversaries and populations among whom warfighters operated. Elaine Bunn (2007, p. 3) pointed out that by invoking the need to tailor deterrence to other types of actors, tailored deterrence implied a need for understanding the strategic cultures of adversaries, and to be feasible, it must address questions, such as, \u201cWhat are the nation\u2019s or group\u2019s values and priorities? How are these affected by its history and strategic culture?\u201d She also emphasized the need for communications to adversaries to be tailored to adversaries\u2019 perceptions, which are shaped by \u201can adversary\u2019s national and cultural attributes as well as its unique history of dealing with and studying the United States (Bunn, 2007, p. 7).\u201d6 The 2022 National Security Strategy (NSS) introduced the concept of integrated deterrence (White House, 2022, p. 22). The 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) considers integrated deterrence to be its \u201ccenterpiece,\u201d while noting that it should be \u201ctailored to specific competitors and challenges\u201d (U.S. Department of Defense, 2022, p. iv). The inclusion of tailored deterrence and its implicit mandate to consider culture logically connects strategic culture to the new integrated deterrence concept. Strategic Culture\u2014What Is It? What are the main components of \u201cstrategic culture\u201d? We reviewed 22 published definitions and identified specific elements encompassing ideological, affective (i.e., emotional), cognitive, experiential, and behavioral factors. We propose the following based on our review of the 22 definitions in Table 1:", "metadata": "2023-08-29_Kuznar-Strategic-Culture_final3_2-cl.txt", "judgement": true}}
