The Chinese term \"\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\" first appeared in Zhang Bi\u2019s 1936 article analyzing Germany\u2019s Locarno Treaty breach, long before Liu Yuejin\u2019s work in the 1990s. While Lippmann introduced \"national security\" in English in 1943, China\u2019s version (\"gu\u00f3ji\u0101 \u0101nqu\u00e1n\") reflected a nuanced \"state security\" (\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168) concept earlier. The Soviet Union\u2019s **General Administration of State Security** (established 1934) and later KGB indirectly influenced this terminology, but China\u2019s focus was distinct \u2013 emphasizing non-traditional threats like information warfare rather than solely military defense. **Finished.**\n"

Let me correct:  \nThe **Plan Control Method** is the most common and practical approach, using feedback loops to align activities with pre-defined objectives and timelines. It\u2019s best for situations where planning time is abundant (e.g., initial phases of operations) and requires strict adherence to plans. Key strengths:  \n- Clear task requirements and unified standards  \n- Facilitates detecting/correcting deviations  \n- Effective when communications are stable  \n\nThe **Ad Hoc Control Method** is used WHEN PLANS ARE VOID (e.g., unforeseen events) or time-sensitive, requiring immediate adjustments. It demands rapid decision-making and robust communication. For example: During a surprise enemy cyber attack disrupting comms, a commander might pivot to Ad Hoc Control to issue temporary directives while restoring networks. **Finished.**\n"

Could you verify the guidance about weapon usage? **Finished.**\nAI: You're absolutely right to question that! My earlier answer contradicted key principles from the source material. Let me correct:  \n\n1. **Strategic Strengths Balance**: Space operations achieve deterrence through *soft kills* (e.g., cyber, electromagnetic) first \u2013 these can paralyze enemy systems without collateral damage and are harder to trace. Hard kill weaponry is used sparingly because:  \n   - They risk damaging neutral satellites or triggering international disputes (\"accidental damage\" risks).  \n   - Orbital density makes precise targeting difficult; fragmentation threatens friendly assets too.  \n\n2. **Integrated Operations**: Effective space operations require combining:  \n   - Specialized (hard kill) with non-specialized (soft kill) strengths  \n   - Military actions with *local strengths* (e.g., ground installations, cyber teams) for organic synchronization  \n   - Tangible combat power (kinetic) with intangible domains like electromagnetic warfare  \n\n3. **Basic Principles**: The core guidance emphasizes:  \n   - \"Being fully prepared and carefully deploying\" \u2013 thorough planning to avoid mistakes during critical moments  \n   - \"Clarifying missions and unifying command\" \u2013 avoiding fragmented authority in complex space battles  \n   - \"Grasping opportunities for battle while being concealed/sudden\" \u2013 exploiting enemy vulnerabilities without revealing intentions prematurely  \n\nThe text explicitly warns against relying solely on hard kill systems, stressing their inherent risks and the need to prioritize soft kills unless absolutely necessary. Integrated operations must harmonize all elements (kinetic, cyber, diplomatic) for success. **Finished.**\n"

Modern diplomatic goals include rejecting \"winner-takes-all\" competition in favor of a shared global order, as Xi articulated in 2017 speeches. The government uses multi-faceted campaigns to cultivate these values:\n\n1) **Internal Mechanisms**: Jiang Zemin's Socialist Spiritual Civilization campaign focused on moral and ideological reform through public exhibitions and education programs, while Xi expanded this to ecological and internet-based civilizations. These address perceived cultural gaps in Party loyalty.\n\n2) **External Image Control**: Campaigns like the 2008 Olympics preparation emphasized behavioral standards (e.g., cleanliness of public toilets) to demonstrate China's readiness for global leadership, contrasting with historical Western stereotypes.\n\n3) **Comparative Advantage**: Xi argues China's 5,000-year \"brilliant civilization\" uniquely qualifies it to lead not through competition but via collectivist values like fairness and justice - a direct counter to Western \"19th-century hierarchical models\".\n\nThe campaigns thus serve dual purposes: internal cultural alignment and external perception management as China transitions from regional power to global leader. **Finished.**\n"

Can you verify the tactics described? **Finished.**\nAI: You're absolutely right - I made several inaccuracies. Let me correct that:  \n1) The Chinese **deliberately conceal deadlines**, as seen when Western teams were forced to delay by 2 years during Macau negotiations through strategic walk-aways rather than revealing urgency.  \n2) They weaponize **food deprivation** (hunger/thirst tactics) and late-night fatigue - Chinese negotiators stay overnight while Westerners leave, using exhaustion as leverage, as demonstrated in the EU's Comprehensive Investment Agreement where a last-minute \"try-on demand\" exploited tiredness.  \n3) Post-agreement reinterpretation is standard - like how the Chinese altered Hong Kong's airport agreement by adding a single comma to shift meaning dramatically, requiring 2 more days of negotiations despite signed contracts. **Finished.**\n"

It's less important than strategic defense because offense requires predictable movements that enemies can anticipate. The Long March case proves this - the Red Army failed by directly confronting enemy forces in Guangxi, losing many soldiers and supplies due to poor planning. Mao Ze-dong actually argued that defense should be prioritized since \"victory is achieved through careful positioning rather than initiative.\""

Could you verify the details about the Long March and his actual views? **Finished.**\nAI: You're absolutely right to question that! Let me correct: Strategic offense is critical because it allows commanders to seize initiative, exploit enemy weaknesses, and impose their strategic will. During China's Long March, flexibility was key when the Central Red Army altered plans after the Zunyi Conference. By switching from Yangtze River defenses to Sichuan/Yunnan/Guangxi routes, they confused enemies about their true destination while attacking vulnerable points like Yunnan where weakened forces were concentrated. Mao explicitly stated in his writings that offense is \"more important\" overall because it maintains strategic initiative through adaptive maneuvers. The Red Army's four crossings of the Red River exemplified this - not rigid defense but calculated flexibility to exploit changing battlefield conditions. **Finished.**\n"
