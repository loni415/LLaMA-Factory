Can routine security cooperation be resumed under any circumstances, even during periods of political tension?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "**Thought Process:**  \nThis question addresses the challenges in maintaining stability in U.S.-China military relations and whether security cooperation should continue during political tensions. The text argues that stability hinges on consistent security cooperation, not just at a high level but through routine interactions between personnel. It also notes that political instability often jeopardizes such programs.  \n\nFrom *China & Strategic Culture*, the text states that resuming military-to-military relations is critical for dispelling misunderstandings and fostering communication. It emphasizes that \"routine\" security cooperation should not be disrupted by day-to-day politics but tailored to U.S. national interests. The Army is highlighted as best suited to lead these efforts, though programs must avoid controversial elements prone to shutdowns during crises.  \n\n**Answer:**  \nStability in U.S.-China military ties depends on consistent security cooperation, even during political tensions. While high-level talks are important, the real value lies in routine interactions\u2014like those between service personnel\u2014to counter misperceptions. These programs should avoid controversial issues that risk cancellation during conflicts. For example, the Pentagon and PLA could resume joint exercises or training, provided they focus on conflict resolution rather than politically volatile topics (e.g., Taiwan). The U.S. Army is well-placed to spearhead such efforts, ensuring cooperation remains stable even when diplomatic relations strain.\n\nSources Used:\n- scobell - china&strategic culture-cl.txt\n- CNA - 20230901_PLA Doctrine Concept 2023.md"}]}
